                  phone number service level quota, you will be blocked from
                  claiming any more numbers until 30 days past the oldest number
                  released has expired. </p> <p>For example, if you already have
                  99 claimed numbers and a service level quota of 99 phone
                  numbers, and in any 30 day period you release 99, claim 99,
                  and then release 99, you will have exceeded the 200% limit. At
                  that point you are blocked from claiming any more numbers
                  until you open an Amazon Web Services support ticket.</p>

                  API. It provides more flexibility, features, and the ability
                  to query longer time ranges than <code>GetMetricData</code>.
                  Use it to retrieve historical agent and contact metrics for
                  the last 3 months, at varying intervals. You can also use it
                  to build custom dashboards to measure historical queue and
                  agent performance. For example, you can track the number of
                  incoming contacts for the last 7 days, with data split by day,
                  to see how contact volume changed per day of the week.</p>

                  <p>StartContactRecording is a one-time action. For example, if

                  call, you can't use StartContactRecording to restart it. For
                  scenarios where the recording has started and you want to
                  suspend and resume it, such as when collecting sensitive
                  information (for example, a credit card number), use
                  SuspendContactRecording and ResumeContactRecording.</p> <p>You

                  <p>Places an outbound call to a contact, and then initiates
                  the flow. It performs the actions in the flow that's specified
                  (in <code>ContactFlowId</code>).</p> <p>Agents do not initiate
                  the outbound API, which means that they do not dial the
                  contact. If the flow places an outbound call to a contact, and
                  then puts the contact in queue, the call is then routed to the
                  agent, like any other inbound case.</p> <p>There is a
                  60-second dialing timeout for this operation. If the call is
                  not connected after 60 seconds, it fails.</p> <note> <p>UK

                  you can dial these UK mobile numbers, you must submit a
                  service quota increase request. For more information, see <a

                  linked task contacts in a chain. That is, 12 task contacts can
                  be created that share the same
                  <code>PreviousContactId</code>.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>
                  <code>RelatedContactId</code> </p> <ul> <li> <p>Copies contact
                  attributes from the related task contact to the new

                  Only one parameter is required as long as the task template
                  has a flow configured to run it. If more than one parameter is

                  specified but it does not have a flow configured, the request

                  <code>ServiceQuotaExceededException</code> occurs when the

                  StopContactRecording is a one-time action. If you use
                  StopContactRecording to stop recording an ongoing call, you
                  can't use StartContactRecording to restart it. For scenarios
                  where the recording has started and you want to suspend it for
                  sensitive information (for example, to collect a credit card
                  number), and then restart it, use SuspendContactRecording and
                  ResumeContactRecording.</p> <p>Only voice recordings are
                  supported at this time.</p>

                  <p>When a contact is being recorded, this API suspends
                  recording whatever is selected in the flow configuration:
                  call, screen, or both. If only call recording or only screen
                  recording is enabled, then it would be suspended. For example,
                  you might suspend the screen recording while collecting
                  sensitive information, such as a credit card number. Then use
                  ResumeContactRecording to restart recording the screen.</p>

                  filled with silence in the final recording.</p> <p>Voice and

                  <p>This API is in preview release for Amazon Connect and is
                  subject to change.</p> <p>Updates routing priority and age on
                  the contact (<b>QueuePriority</b> and
                  <b>QueueTimeAdjustmentInSeconds</b>). These properties can be
                  used to change a customer's position in the queue. For
                  example, you can move a contact to the back of the queue by
                  setting a lower routing priority relative to other contacts in
                  queue; or you can move a contact to the front of the queue by
                  increasing the routing age which will make the contact look
                  artificially older and therefore higher up in the
                  first-in-first-out routing order. Note that adjusting the
                  routing age of a contact affects only its position in queue,
                  and not its actual queue wait time as reported through
                  metrics. These properties can also be updated by using <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/change-routing-priority.html">the
                  Set routing priority / age flow block</a>.</p>

                  <p>Updates the identity information for the specified
                  user.</p> <important> <p>We strongly recommend limiting who
                  has the ability to invoke <code>UpdateUserIdentityInfo</code>.
                  Someone with that ability can change the login credentials of
                  other users by changing their email address. This poses a
                  security risk to your organization. They can change the email
                  address of a user to the attacker's email address, and then
                  reset the password through email. For more information, see <a

                  operation returns for summaries, one for each numbered version
                  and one for the <code>DRAFT</code> version.</p> <p>The

                  objects. In each object, use the <code>name</code> field to
                  specify the metric to calculate, the <code>statistic</code>
                  field to specify whether to calculate the <code>Sum</code>,
                  <code>Average</code>, or <code>Max</code> number, and the
                  <code>order</code> field to specify whether to sort the

                  filter the results, the <code>groupBy</code> field to specify

                  to return in a single response and the <code>nextToken</code>
                  field to return the next batch of results if the response does
                  not return the full set of results.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note
                  that an <code>order</code> field exists in both

                  permissions to perform the <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/APIReference/API_ListAggregatedUtterances.html">ListAggregatedUtterances</a>
                  operation, which provides access to utterance-related
                  analytics. See <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/monitoring-utterances.html">Viewing
                  utterance statistics</a> for the IAM policy to apply to the
                  IAM role.</p> </note> <p>Retrieves summary metrics for the
                  utterances in your bot. The following fields are required:</p>
                  <ul> <li> <p> <code>metrics</code> – A list of <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/APIReference/API_AnalyticsUtteranceMetric.html">AnalyticsUtteranceMetric</a>
                  objects. In each object, use the <code>name</code> field to
                  specify the metric to calculate, the <code>statistic</code>
                  field to specify whether to calculate the <code>Sum</code>,
                  <code>Average</code>, or <code>Max</code> number, and the
                  <code>order</code> field to specify whether to sort the
                  results in <code>Ascending</code> or <code>Descending</code>
                  order.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>startDateTime</code> and
                  <code>endDateTime</code> – Define a time range for which you
                  want to retrieve results.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Of the optional
                  fields, you can organize the results in the following
                  ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use the <code>filters</code> field to
                  filter the results, the <code>groupBy</code> field to specify
                  categories by which to group the results, and the
                  <code>binBy</code> field to specify time intervals by which to
                  group the results.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the
                  <code>maxResults</code> field to limit the number of results
                  to return in a single response and the <code>nextToken</code>
                  field to return the next batch of results if the response does
                  not return the full set of results.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note
                  that an <code>order</code> field exists in both
                  <code>binBy</code> and <code>metrics</code>. Currently, you
                  can specify it in either field, but not in both.</p>

                  <p>This action initiates a multipart upload and returns an
                  upload ID. This upload ID is used to associate all of the
                  parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this
                  upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see
                  <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html">UploadPart</a>).
                  You also include this upload ID in the final request to either
                  complete or abort the multipart upload request. For more
                  information about multipart uploads, see <a

                  <note> <p>After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one
                  or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded
                  parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload.
                  Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stops
                  charging you for storing them only after you either complete
                  or abort a multipart upload. </p> </note> <p>If you have
                  configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart
                  uploads, the created multipart upload must be completed within
                  the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle
                  configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload
                  becomes eligible for an abort action and Amazon S3 aborts the
                  multipart upload. For more information, see <a

                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html">
                  <code>CreateSession</code> </a> API operation for
                  session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the
                  <code>s3express:CreateSession</code> permission to the
                  directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based
                  policy. Then, you make the <code>CreateSession</code> API call
                  on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session
                  token in your request header, you can make API requests to
                  this operation. After the session token expires, you make
                  another <code>CreateSession</code> API call to generate a new
                  session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create
                  session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid
                  service interruptions when a session expires. For more

                  buckets</b> - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at
                  rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in
                  its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. Amazon S3
                  automatically encrypts all new objects that are uploaded to an
                  S3 bucket. When doing a multipart upload, if you don't specify
                  encryption information in your request, the encryption setting
                  of the uploaded parts is set to the default encryption
                  configuration of the destination bucket. By default, all
                  buckets have a base level of encryption configuration that
                  uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys
                  (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a default encryption
                  configuration that uses server-side encryption with an Key
                  Management Service (KMS) key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided
                  encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding KMS
                  key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the uploaded parts.
                  When you perform a CreateMultipartUpload operation, if you
                  want to use a different type of encryption setting for the
                  uploaded parts, you can request that Amazon S3 encrypts the
                  object with a different encryption key (such as an Amazon S3
                  managed key, a KMS key, or a customer-provided key). When the
                  encryption setting in your request is different from the
                  default encryption configuration of the destination bucket,
                  the encryption setting in your request takes precedence. If
                  you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request

                  credentials to support fast authentication and authorization
                  for the Zonal endpoint APIs on directory buckets. For more
                  information about Zonal endpoint APIs that include the

                  </p> <p>To make Zonal endpoint API requests on a directory
                  bucket, use the <code>CreateSession</code> API operation.
                  Specifically, you grant <code>s3express:CreateSession</code>
                  permission to a bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM
                  identity-based policy. Then, you use IAM credentials to make
                  the <code>CreateSession</code> API request on the bucket,
                  which returns temporary security credentials that include the
                  access key ID, secret access key, session token, and
                  expiration. These credentials have associated permissions to
                  access the Zonal endpoint APIs. After the session is created,
                  you don’t need to use other policies to grant permissions to
                  each Zonal endpoint API individually. Instead, in your Zonal
                  endpoint API requests, you sign your requests by applying the
                  temporary security credentials of the session to the request
                  headers and following the SigV4 protocol for authentication.
                  You also apply the session token to the
                  <code>x-amz-s3session-token</code> request header for
                  authorization. Temporary security credentials are scoped to
                  the bucket and expire after 5 minutes. After the expiration
                  time, any calls that you make with those credentials will
                  fail. You must use IAM credentials again to make a
                  <code>CreateSession</code> API request that generates a new
                  set of temporary credentials for use. Temporary credentials
                  cannot be extended or refreshed beyond the original specified
                  interval.</p> <p>If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs
                  handle the session token refreshes automatically to avoid
                  service interruptions when a session expires. We recommend
                  that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to initiate and
                  manage requests to the CreateSession API. For more

                  bucket so that the bucket can service cross-origin requests.
                  For example, you might want to enable a request whose origin
                  is <code>http://www.example.com</code> to access your Amazon
                  S3 bucket at <code>my.example.bucket.com</code> by using the
                  browser's <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> capability.</p> <p>To
                  enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you
                  add the <code>cors</code> subresource to the bucket. The
                  <code>cors</code> subresource is an XML document in which you
                  configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP methods
                  that can be executed on your bucket. The document is limited
                  to 64 KB in size. </p> <p>When Amazon S3 receives a
                  cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS request) against
                  a bucket, it evaluates the <code>cors</code> configuration on
                  the bucket and uses the first <code>CORSRule</code> rule that
                  matches the incoming browser request to enable a cross-origin
                  request. For a rule to match, the following conditions must be
                  met:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The request's <code>Origin</code> header
                  must match <code>AllowedOrigin</code> elements.</p> </li> <li>
                  <p>The request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD, and so on)
                  or the <code>Access-Control-Request-Method</code> header in
                  case of a pre-flight <code>OPTIONS</code> request must be one
                  of the <code>AllowedMethod</code> elements. </p> </li> <li>
                  <p>Every header specified in the
                  <code>Access-Control-Request-Headers</code> request header of

                  most cost-effective storage access tier, without performance
                  impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering
                  delivers automatic cost savings in three low latency and high
                  throughput access tiers. To get the lowest storage cost on
                  data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose
                  to activate additional archiving capabilities.</p> <p>The S3
                  Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class
                  for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access
                  patterns, independent of object size or retention period. If
                  the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored
                  and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be
                  stored, but they are always charged at the Frequent Access
                  tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.</p>

                  see the cost of combined resources, organize your billing
                  information according to resources with the same tag key
                  values. For example, you can tag several resources with a
                  specific application name, and then organize your billing
                  information to see the total cost of that application across
                  several services. For more information, see <a

                  <p>This operation enables you to delete multiple objects from
                  a bucket using a single HTTP request. If you know the object
                  keys that you want to delete, then this operation provides a
                  suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests,
                  reducing per-request overhead.</p> <p>The request can contain
                  a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML,
                  you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs
                  if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a
                  versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a
                  delete operation and returns the result of that delete,
                  success or failure, in the response. Note that if the object
                  specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the
                  result as deleted.</p> <note> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Directory

                  - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API
                  operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support
                  virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
                  <code>https://<i>bucket_name</i>.s3express-<i>az_id</i>.<i>region</i>.amazonaws.com/<i>key-name</i>
                  </code>. Path-style requests are not supported. For more

                  two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the
                  operation uses verbose mode in which the response includes the
                  result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode
                  the response includes only keys where the delete operation
                  encountered an error. For a successful deletion in a quiet
                  mode, the operation does not return any information about the
                  delete in the response body.</p> <p>When performing this
                  action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to
                  delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token.
                  If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even
                  if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete.
                  If you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned
                  keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete
                  request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see <a

                  <code>CreateSession</code> </a> API operation for
                  session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the
                  <code>s3express:CreateSession</code> permission to the
                  directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based
                  policy. Then, you make the <code>CreateSession</code> API call
                  on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session
                  token in your request header, you can make API requests to
                  this operation. After the session token expires, you make
                  another <code>CreateSession</code> API call to generate a new
                  session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create
                  session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid
                  service interruptions when a session expires. For more

                  <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header. Amazon S3 supports a

                  canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions.
                  Specify the canned ACL name as the value of

                  grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups)
                  who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific

                  <code>&lt;NotificationConfiguration&gt;</code> </p> <p>
                  <code>&lt;/NotificationConfiguration&gt;</code> </p> <p>This
                  action replaces the existing notification configuration with
                  the configuration you include in the request body.</p>
                  <p>After Amazon S3 receives this request, it first verifies
                  that any Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) or
                  Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) destination exists,
                  and that the bucket owner has permission to publish to it by
                  sending a test notification. In the case of Lambda
                  destinations, Amazon S3 verifies that the Lambda function
                  permissions grant Amazon S3 permission to invoke the function
                  from the Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html">Configuring
                  Notifications for Amazon S3 Events</a>.</p> <p>You can disable
                  notifications by adding the empty NotificationConfiguration
                  element.</p> <p>For more information about the number of event
                  notification configurations that you can create per bucket,
                  see <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html#limits_s3">Amazon
                  S3 service quotas</a> in <i>Amazon Web Services General
                  Reference</i>.</p> <p>By default, only the bucket owner can
                  configure notifications on a bucket. However, bucket owners
                  can use a bucket policy to grant permission to other users to
                  set this configuration with the required
                  <code>s3:PutBucketNotification</code> permission.</p> <note>
                  <p>The PUT notification is an atomic operation. For example,
                  suppose your notification configuration includes SNS topic,
                  SQS queue, and Lambda function configurations. When you send a
                  PUT request with this configuration, Amazon S3 sends test
                  messages to your SNS topic. If the message fails, the entire
                  PUT action will fail, and Amazon S3 will not add the
                  configuration to your bucket.</p> </note> <p>If the
                  configuration in the request body includes only one
                  <code>TopicConfiguration</code> specifying only the
                  <code>s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject</code> event type, the
                  response will also include the
                  <code>x-amz-sns-test-message-id</code> header containing the
                  message ID of the test notification sent to the topic.</p>

                  <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL with the
                  <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header. Amazon S3 supports a
                  set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL
                  has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the
                  canned ACL name as the value of <code>x-amz-ac</code>l. If you
                  use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific
                  headers in your request. For more information, see <a

                  <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. When using
                  these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and
                  grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups)
                  who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific

                  <p>This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads in a
                  bucket. An in-progress multipart upload is a multipart upload
                  that has been initiated by the
                  <code>CreateMultipartUpload</code> request, but has not yet
                  been completed or aborted.</p> <note> <p> <b>Directory
                  buckets</b> - If multipart uploads in a directory bucket are
                  in progress, you can't delete the bucket until all the
                  in-progress multipart uploads are aborted or completed. </p>
                  </note> <p>The <code>ListMultipartUploads</code> operation
                  returns a maximum of 1,000 multipart uploads in the response.
                  The limit of 1,000 multipart uploads is also the default
                  value. You can further limit the number of uploads in a
                  response by specifying the <code>max-uploads</code> request
                  parameter. If there are more than 1,000 multipart uploads that
                  satisfy your <code>ListMultipartUploads</code> request, the
                  response returns an <code>IsTruncated</code> element with the
                  value of <code>true</code>, a <code>NextKeyMarker</code>
                  element, and a <code>NextUploadIdMarker</code> element. To
                  list the remaining multipart uploads, you need to make
                  subsequent <code>ListMultipartUploads</code> requests. In
                  these requests, include two query parameters:
                  <code>key-marker</code> and <code>upload-id-marker</code>. Set
                  the value of <code>key-marker</code> to the
                  <code>NextKeyMarker</code> value from the previous response.
                  Similarly, set the value of <code>upload-id-marker</code> to
                  the <code>NextUploadIdMarker</code> value from the previous
                  response.</p> <note> <p> <b>Directory buckets</b> - The
                  <code>upload-id-marker</code> element and the
                  <code>NextUploadIdMarker</code> element aren't supported by
                  directory buckets. To list the additional multipart uploads,
                  you only need to set the value of <code>key-marker</code> to
                  the <code>NextKeyMarker</code> value from the previous
                  response. </p> </note> <p>For more information about multipart

                  <code>CreateSession</code> </a> API operation for
                  session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the
                  <code>s3express:CreateSession</code> permission to the
                  directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based
                  policy. Then, you make the <code>CreateSession</code> API call
                  on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session
                  token in your request header, you can make API requests to
                  this operation. After the session token expires, you make
                  another <code>CreateSession</code> API call to generate a new
                  session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create
                  session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid

                  <code>ErrorCode</code>, and <code>ErrorMessage</code>. The
                  <code>GetObject</code> response metadata is supported so that
                  the <code>WriteGetObjectResponse</code> caller, typically an
                  Lambda function, can provide the same metadata when it

                  Amazon S3 would normally return.</p> <p>You can include any
                  number of metadata headers. When including a metadata header,
                  it should be prefaced with <code>x-amz-meta</code>. For
                  example, <code>x-amz-meta-my-custom-header:
                  MyCustomValue</code>. The primary use case for this is to
                  forward <code>GetObject</code> metadata.</p> <p>Amazon Web
                  Services provides some prebuilt Lambda functions that you can
                  use with S3 Object Lambda to detect and redact personally
                  identifiable information (PII) and decompress S3 objects.
                  These Lambda functions are available in the Amazon Web
                  Services Serverless Application Repository, and can be
                  selected through the Amazon Web Services Management Console
                  when you create your Object Lambda access point.</p>
                  <p>Example 1: PII Access Control - This Lambda function uses
                  Amazon Comprehend, a natural language processing (NLP) service
                  using machine learning to find insights and relationships in
                  text. It automatically detects personally identifiable
                  information (PII) such as names, addresses, dates, credit card
                  numbers, and social security numbers from documents in your
                  Amazon S3 bucket. </p> <p>Example 2: PII Redaction - This
                  Lambda function uses Amazon Comprehend, a natural language
                  processing (NLP) service using machine learning to find
                  insights and relationships in text. It automatically redacts
                  personally identifiable information (PII) such as names,
                  addresses, dates, credit card numbers, and social security
                  numbers from documents in your Amazon S3 bucket. </p>
                  <p>Example 3: Decompression - The Lambda function
                  S3ObjectLambdaDecompression, is equipped to decompress objects
                  stored in S3 in one of six compressed file formats including

                  Creates a new piece of content or publishes an existing draft.


                  To publish a draft, add the `id` and `status` properties to
                  the body of the request.

                  Set the `id` to the ID of the draft and set the `status` to
                  'current'. When the

                  request is sent, a new piece of content will be created and
                  the metadata from the

                  draft will be transferred into it.


                  By default, the following objects are expanded: `space`,
                  `history`, `version`.

                  Example initial call:

                  ```

                  /wiki/rest/api/content/search?cql=type=page&limit=25

                  ```


                  Example response:

                  ```

                  {
                    "results": [
                      { ... },

                      ...
                      { ... }
                    ],
                    "limit": 25,
                    "size": 25,
                    ...
                    "_links": {
                      "base": "<url>",
                      "context": "<url>",
                      "next": "/rest/api/content/search?cql=type=page&limit=25&cursor=raNDoMsTRiNg",

                    }
                  }

                  ```


                  When additional results are available, returns `next` and
                  `prev` URLs to retrieve them in subsequent calls. The URLs
                  each contain a cursor that points to the appropriate set of
                  results. Use `limit` to specify the number of results returned
                  in each call.

                  Example subsequent call (taken from example response):

                  ```

                  /wiki/rest/api/content/search?cql=type=page&limit=25&cursor=raNDoMsTRiNg

                  ```

                  The response to this will have a `prev` URL similar to the
                  `next` in the example response.

                  Deprecated, use [Confluence's v2
                  API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/v2/intro/).


                  Returns a map of the direct children of a piece of content. A
                  piece of content

                  has different types of child content, depending on its type.
                  These are

                  the default parent-child content type relationships:


                  - `page`: child content is `page`, `comment`, `attachment`

                  - `blogpost`: child content is `comment`, `attachment`

                  - `attachment`: child content is `comment`

                  - `comment`: child content is `attachment`


                  Apps can override these default relationships. Apps can also
                  introduce

                  new content types that create new parent-child content
                  relationships.


                  Note, the map will always include all child content types that
                  are valid

                  for the content. However, if the content has no instances of a
                  child content

                  type, the map will contain an empty array for that child
                  content type.

                  Caution: This API can move pages to the top level of a space.
                  Top-level pages are difficult to find in the UI

                  because they do not show up in the page tree display. To avoid
                  this, never use `before` or `after` positions

                  when the `targetId` is a top-level page.

                  version of the

                  attachment is created).


                  Note, you must set a `X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck` header on
                  the request

                  for this method, otherwise it will be blocked. This protects

                  attacks, which is necessary as this method accepts
                  multipart/form-data.


                  The media type 'multipart/form-data' is defined in [RFC
                  7578](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7578.txt).

                  Most client libraries have classes that make it easier to
                  implement

                  multipart posts, like the
                  [MultipartEntityBuilder](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.1.x/current/httpclient5/apidocs/)

                  Java class provided by Apache HTTP Components.


                  Note, according to [RFC
                  7578](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7578#section-4.5),

                  in the case where the form data is text,

                  the charset parameter for the "text/plain" Content-Type may be
                  used to

                  indicate the character encoding used in that part. In the case
                  of this

                  API endpoint, the `comment` body parameter should be sent with
                  `type=text/plain`

                  and `charset=utf-8` values. This will force the charset to be
                  UTF-8.


                  Example: This curl command attaches a file ('example.txt') to
                  a piece of

                  content (id='123') with a comment and `minorEdits`=true. If
                  the 'example.txt'

                  file already exists, it will update it with a new version of
                  the attachment.


                  ``` bash

                  curl -D- \

                  used to

                  indicate the character encoding used in that part. In the case
                  of this

                  API endpoint, the `comment` body parameter should be sent with
                  `type=text/plain`

                  and `charset=utf-8` values. This will force the charset to be
                  UTF-8.


                  Example: This curl command updates an attachment (id='att456')
                  that is attached

                  to a piece of content (id='123') with a comment and
                  `minorEdits`=true.


                  ``` bash

                  curl -D- \
                    -u admin:admin \
                    -X POST \
                    -H 'X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck' \
                    -F 'file=@"example.txt"' \
                    -F 'minorEdit="true"' \
                    -F 'comment="Example attachment comment"; type=text/plain; charset=utf-8' \

                  Returns a map of the descendants of a piece of content. This
                  is similar

                  to [Get content children](#api-content-id-child-get), except
                  that this

                  method returns child pages at all levels, rather than just the
                  direct

                  child pages.


                  A piece of content has different types of descendants,
                  depending on its type:


                  - `page`: descendant is `page`, `comment`, `attachment`

                  - `blogpost`: descendant is `comment`, `attachment`

                  - `attachment`: descendant is `comment`

                  - `comment`: descendant is `attachment`


                  The map will always include all descendant types that are
                  valid for the content.

                  However, if the content has no instances of a descendant type,
                  the map will

                  contain an empty array for that descendant type.

                description: >-
                  Returns the body of a macro in storage format, for the given
                  macro ID.

                  This includes information like the name of the macro, the body
                  of the macro,

                  and any macro parameters. This method is mainly used by Cloud
                  apps.


                  About the macro ID: When a macro is created in a new version
                  of content,

                  Confluence will generate a random ID for it, unless an ID is
                  specified

                  (by an app). The macro ID will look similar to this:
                  '50884bd9-0cb8-41d5-98be-f80943c14f96'.

                  The ID is then persisted as new versions of content are
                  created, and is

                  only modified by Confluence if there are conflicting IDs.


                  Note, to preserve backwards compatibility this resource will
                  also match on

                  the hash of the macro body, even if a macro ID is found. This
                  check will

                  eventually become redundant, as macro IDs are generated for
                  pages and

                  transparently propagate out to all instances.

                  Returns the body of a macro in format specified in path, for
                  the given macro ID.

                  This includes information like the name of the macro, the body
                  of the macro,

                  and any macro parameters.


                  About the macro ID: When a macro is created in a new version
                  of content,

                  Confluence will generate a random ID for it, unless an ID is
                  specified

                  (by an app). The macro ID will look similar to this:
                  '50884bd9-0cb8-41d5-98be-f80943c14f96'.

                  The ID is then persisted as new versions of content are
                  created, and is

                  only modified by Confluence if there are conflicting IDs.


                  Note, to preserve backwards compatibility this resource will
                  also match on

                  the hash of the macro body, even if a macro ID is found. This
                  check will

                  eventually become redundant, as macro IDs are generated for
                  pages and

                  transparently propagate out to all instances.

                description: >-
                  Copy page hierarchy allows the copying of an entire hierarchy
                  of pages and their associated properties, permissions and
                  attachments.
                   The id path parameter refers to the content id of the page to copy, and the new parent of this copied page is defined using the destinationPageId in the request body.
                   The titleOptions object defines the rules of renaming page titles during the copy;
                   for example, search and replace can be used in conjunction to rewrite the copied page titles.

                   Response example:
                   <pre><code>
                   {
                        "id" : "1180606",
                        "links" : {
                             "status" : "/rest/api/longtask/1180606"
                        }
                   }
                   </code></pre>
                   Use the /longtask/<taskId> REST API to get the copy task status.

                   The `id` path parameter refers to the content ID of the page to copy. The target of the page to be copied
                   is defined using the `destination` in the request body and can be one of the following types.

                    - `space`: page will be copied to the specified space as a root page on the space
                    - `parent_page`: page will be copied as a child of the specified parent page
                    - `existing_page`: page will be copied and replace the specified page

                  By default, the following objects are expanded: `space`,
                  `history`, `version`.

                  Returns whether the specified content restriction applies to a
                  group.

                  For example, if a page with `id=123` has a `read` restriction
                  for the `admins` group,

                  the following request will return `true`:

                  Note that a response of `true` does not guarantee that the
                  group can view the page, as it does not account for

                  account-inherited restrictions, space permissions, or even
                  product access. For more

                description: >-
                  Returns whether the specified content restriction applies to a
                  group.

                  For example, if a page with `id=123` has a `read` restriction
                  for the `123456` group id,

                  the following request will return `true`:


                  `/wiki/rest/api/content/123/restriction/byOperation/read/byGroupId/123456`


                  Note that a response of `true` does not guarantee that the
                  group can view the page, as it does not account for

                  account-inherited restrictions, space permissions, or even
                  product access. For more

                  `GET

                  Note, 'ignore' is an example custom relationship type.

                  For example, the following method finds all users that have a
                  'collaborator'

                  relationship to a piece of content with an ID of '1234':

                  `GET
                  /wiki/rest/api/relation/collaborator/to/content/1234/from/user`

                  Note, 'collaborator' is an example custom relationship type.

                  (CQL)](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/advanced-searching-using-cql/).


                  **Note that CQL input queries submitted through the
                  `/wiki/rest/api/search` endpoint no longer support
                  user-specific fields like `user`, `user.fullname`,
                  `user.accountid`, and `user.userkey`.** 

                  See this [deprecation
                  notice](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/deprecation-notice-search-api/)
                  for more details.


                  Example initial call:

                  ```

                  /wiki/rest/api/search?cql=type=page&limit=25

                  ```


                  Example response:

                  ```

                  {
                    "results": [
                      { ... },
                      { ... },
                      ...
                      { ... }
                    ],
                    "limit": 25,
                    "size": 25,
                    ...
                    "_links": {
                      "base": "<url>",
                      "context": "<url>",
                      "next": "/rest/api/search?cql=type=page&limit=25&cursor=raNDoMsTRiNg",
                      "self": "<url>"
                    }
                  }

                  ```


                  When additional results are available, returns `next` and
                  `prev` URLs to retrieve them in subsequent calls. The URLs
                  each contain a cursor that points to the appropriate set of
                  results. Use `limit` to specify the number of results returned
                  in each call.


                  Example subsequent call (taken from example response):

                  ```

                  /wiki/rest/api/search?cql=type=page&limit=25&cursor=raNDoMsTRiNg

                  ```

                  The response to this will have a `prev` URL similar to the
                  `next` in the example response.

                  -   For security reasons, permissions cannot be updated via
                  the API and

                  must be changed via the user interface instead.

                  -   Currently you cannot set space labels when updating a
                  space.

                  Creates a new space property. This is the same as `POST

                  /wiki/rest/api/space/{spaceKey}/property` but the key for the
                  property is passed as a

                  path parameter, rather than in the request body.

                  Deletes a template. This results in different actions
                  depending on the

                  type of template:


                  - If the template is a content template, it is deleted.

                  - If the template is a modified space-level blueprint
                  template, it reverts

                  to the template inherited from the global-level blueprint
                  template.

                  - If the template is a modified global-level blueprint
                  template, it reverts

                  to the default global-level blueprint template.

                   Note, unmodified blueprint templates cannot be deleted.

                anchor: about
                body: >-
                  This is the reference for the Confluence Cloud REST API. This
                  API is the primary way to get and

                  modify data in Confluence Cloud, whether you are developing an
                  app or any other integration.

                  Use it to interact with Confluence entities, like pages and
                  blog posts, spaces, users, groups,

                  and more.
              - title: Authentication and authorization
                anchor: auth
                body: >-
                  **Authentication:** If you are building a Cloud app,
                  authentication is implemented via JWT or OAuth 2.0, depending
                  on what you are building (see [Security
                  overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/security-overview/)).
                  Otherwise, if you are authenticating directly against the REST
                  API, the REST API supports basic auth (see [Basic auth for
                  REST
                  APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/)).


                  **Authorization:** If you are building a Cloud app,
                  authorization can be implemented by
                  [scopes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/scopes/)
                  or by [OAuth 2.0 user
                  impersonation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/oauth-2-jwt-bearer-tokens-for-apps).
                  Otherwise, if you are making calls directly against the REST
                  API, authorization is based on the user used in the
                  authentication process.


                  See [Security
                  overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/security-overview/)
                  for more details on authentication and authorization.
              - title: Status codes
                anchor: status-code
                body: >-
                  The Confluence REST API uses the [standard HTTP status
                  codes](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).


                  Responses that return an error status code will also return a
                  response body, similar to the following:

                  ```json

                  {
                    "statusCode": 404,
                    "data": {
                      "authorized": false,
                      "valid": false,
                      "errors": [
                        {
                          "message": {
                            "translation": "This is an example error message.",
                            "args": []
                          }
                        }
                      ],
                      "successful": false
                    },
                    "message": "This is an example error message."
                  }

                  ```
              - title: Using the REST API
                anchor: using
                body: >-
                  **Expansion:** The Confluence REST API uses resource
                  expansion: some parts of a resource are not returned unless
                  explicitly specified. This simplifies responses and minimizes
                  network traffic.


                  To expand part of a resource in a request, use the `expand`
                  query parameter and specify the entities to be expanded. If
                  you need to expand nested entities, use the `.` dot notation.
                  For example, the following request will expand information
                  about the requested content's space and labels:

                  ```

                  GET /wiki/rest/api/content/{id}?expand=space,metadata.labels

                  ```

                  **Pagination:** The Confluence REST API uses pagination: a
                  method that returns a response with multiple objects can only
                  return a limited number at one time. This limits the size of
                  responses and conserves server resources.


                  Use the 'limit' and 'start' query parameters to specify
                  pagination:


                  - `limit` is the number of objects to return per page. This
                  may be restricted by system limits.

                  - `start` is the index of the first item returned in the page
                  of results. The base index is 0.


                  For example, the following request will return ten content
                  objects, starting from the fifth object.

                  ```

                  GET /wiki/rest/api/content?start=4&limit=10

                  ```

                  **Special headers:**


                  - `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` request header must be
                  specified for methods

                  that are protected from Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF/CSRF)
                  attacks. This is

                  stated in the method description, if required. For more
                  information, see this

                  [KB

                  **Webhooks:** A webhook is a user-defined callback over HTTP.
                  You can use Confluence webhooks to notify your app or web
                  application when certain events occur in Confluence. For
                  example, when a page is created or updated. To learn more, see
                  [Webhooks](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/modules/webhook/).


                  **Content properties:** Content properties are a key-value
                  storage associated with a piece of Confluence content. If you
                  are building an app, this is one form of persistence that you
                  can use. You can use the Confluence REST API to get, update,
                  and delete content properties. To learn more, see [Content
                  properties in the REST
                  API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/content-properties/).


                  **CQL:** The Confluence Query Language (CQL) allows you to
                  perform complex searches for content using an SQL-like syntax
                  in the `search` resource. To learn more, see [Advanced

                  Returns a list of contextual filters enabled for a particular
                  channel or category.


                  **Usage Notes**


                  Contextual filters allow you to configure the enabled filters
                  per channel or category, so that shoppers can filter by the
                  most relevant criteria.


                  The order of the returned filters will match the sort order of
                  the filters on the storefront.

                  The endpoint does not support partial updates. Provide all
                  fields to update global or channel-level settings.


                  Create channel-level settings, or overrides for a channel,
                  using the `channel_id`  query parameter. 


                  To delete overrides for a channel, supply `null` as a value
                  for all fields. A channel then inherits global values.


                  The endpoint does not support 'null' as a value for
                  global-level settings.

                  ETP classification is divided into three categories: Asset
                  Class, Geography, and Investment Strategy. Asset class is
                  determined based on the various asset types held by the fund,
                  A fund's geography can be classified by region (e.g.
                  Asia-Pac), specific geography (e.g. China) or economic
                  development (e.g. BRIC). An ETP's investment strategy is
                  classified in broad categories (e.g. Large Cap) and more
                  granular categorizations.
