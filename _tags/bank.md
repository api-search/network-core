      This API is used for the classic integration. If you are just starting
      your implementation, refer to our new integration guide instead. The
      Account API provides endpoints for managing account-related entities on
      your platform. These related entities include account holders, accounts,
      bank accounts, shareholders, and verification-related documents. The
      management operations include actions such as creation, retrieval,
      updating, and deletion of them.

                  Updates the `accountHolderDetails` and `processingTier` of an
                  account holder, and adds bank accounts and shareholders.


                  When updating `accountHolderDetails`, parameters that are not
                  included in the request are left unchanged except for the
                  following object:


                  * `metadata`: Updating the metadata replaces the entire
                  object. This means that to update an existing key-value pair,
                  you must provide the changes, as well as other existing
                  key-value pairs.


                  When updating any field in the following objects, you must
                  submit all the fields required for validation:

                   * `address`

                  * `fullPhoneNumber`


                  * `bankAccountDetails.BankAccountDetail`


                  * `businessDetails.shareholders.ShareholderContact`

                   For example, to update the `address.postalCode`, you must also submit the `address.country`, `.city`, `.street`, `.postalCode`, and possibly `.stateOrProvince` so that the address can be validated.

                  To add a bank account or shareholder, provide the bank account
                  or shareholder details without a `bankAccountUUID` or a
                  `shareholderCode`.

                  Get a collection of events for a given user. You can add query
                  the parameters monetary_account_id, status and/or
                  display_user_event to filter the response. When
                  monetary_account_id={id,id} is provided only events that
                  relate to these monetary account ids are returned. When
                  status={AWAITING_REPLY/FINALIZED} is provided the response
                  only contains events with the status AWAITING_REPLY or
                  FINALIZED. When display_user_event={true/false} is set to
                  false user events are excluded from the response, when not
                  provided user events are displayed. User events are events
                  that are not related to a monetary account (for example:
                  connect invites).

                  headers.
                   You provide the server with the public part of the key pair that you are going to use to create the value of the signature header for all future API calls. The server creates an installation for you. Store the Installation Token and ServerPublicKey from the response. This token is used in the "X-Bunq-Client-Authentication" header for the creation of a DeviceServer and SessionServer.
