      <important> <p> <b>Most of these APIs are no longer supported and will not
      be updated.</b> We recommend using the latest versions in the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/APIReference/welcome.html">Amazon
      Chime SDK API reference</a>, in the Amazon Chime SDK.</p> <p>Using the
      latest versions requires migrating to dedicated namespaces. For more
      information, refer to <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/dg/migrate-from-chm-namespace.html">Migrating
      from the Amazon Chime namespace</a> in the <i>Amazon Chime SDK Developer
      Guide</i>.</p> </important> <p>The Amazon Chime application programming
      interface (API) is designed so administrators can perform key tasks, such
      as creating and managing Amazon Chime accounts, users, and Voice
      Connectors. This guide provides detailed information about the Amazon
      Chime API, including operations, types, inputs and outputs, and error
      codes.</p> <p>You can use an AWS SDK, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS
      CLI), or the REST API to make API calls for Amazon Chime. We recommend
      using an AWS SDK or the AWS CLI. The page for each API action contains a
      <i>See Also</i> section that includes links to information about using the
      action with a language-specific AWS SDK or the AWS CLI.</p> <dl> <dt>Using
      an AWS SDK</dt> <dd> <p> You don't need to write code to calculate a
      signature for request authentication. The SDK clients authenticate your
      requests by using access keys that you provide. For more information about
      AWS SDKs, see the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/developer/">AWS Developer
      Center</a>. </p> </dd> <dt>Using the AWS CLI</dt> <dd> <p>Use your access
      keys with the AWS CLI to make API calls. For information about setting up
      the AWS CLI, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html">Installing
      the AWS Command Line Interface</a> in the <i>AWS Command Line Interface
      User Guide</i>. For a list of available Amazon Chime commands, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/chime/index.html">Amazon
      Chime commands</a> in the <i>AWS CLI Command Reference</i>. </p> </dd>
      <dt>Using REST APIs</dt> <dd> <p>If you use REST to make API calls, you
      must authenticate your request by providing a signature. Amazon Chime
      supports Signature Version 4. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature
      Version 4 Signing Process</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General
      Reference</i>.</p> <p>When making REST API calls, use the service name
      <code>chime</code> and REST endpoint
      <code>https://service.chime.aws.amazon.com</code>.</p> </dd> </dl>
      <p>Administrative permissions are controlled using AWS Identity and Access
      Management (IAM). For more information, see <a
