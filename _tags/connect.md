      <p>Amazon Web Services AppFabric quickly connects software as a service
      (SaaS) applications across your organization. This allows IT and security
      teams to easily manage and secure applications using a standard schema,
      and employees can complete everyday tasks faster using generative
      artificial intelligence (AI). You can use these APIs to complete AppFabric
      tasks, such as setting up audit log ingestions or viewing user access. For
      more information about AppFabric, including the required permissions to
      use the service, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/latest/adminguide/">Amazon Web
      Services AppFabric Administration Guide</a>. For more information about
      using the Command Line Interface (CLI) to manage your AppFabric resources,
      see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/appfabric/index.html">AppFabric
      section of the CLI Reference</a>.</p>

                  phone number service level quota, you will be blocked from
                  claiming any more numbers until 30 days past the oldest number
                  released has expired. </p> <p>For example, if you already have
                  99 claimed numbers and a service level quota of 99 phone
                  numbers, and in any 30 day period you release 99, claim 99,
                  and then release 99, you will have exceeded the 200% limit. At
                  that point you are blocked from claiming any more numbers
                  until you open an Amazon Web Services support ticket.</p>

                  API. It provides more flexibility, features, and the ability
                  to query longer time ranges than <code>GetMetricData</code>.
                  Use it to retrieve historical agent and contact metrics for
                  the last 3 months, at varying intervals. You can also use it
                  to build custom dashboards to measure historical queue and
                  agent performance. For example, you can track the number of
                  incoming contacts for the last 7 days, with data split by day,
                  to see how contact volume changed per day of the week.</p>

                  <p>StartContactRecording is a one-time action. For example, if
                  you use StopContactRecording to stop recording an ongoing
                  call, you can't use StartContactRecording to restart it. For
                  scenarios where the recording has started and you want to
                  suspend and resume it, such as when collecting sensitive
                  information (for example, a credit card number), use
                  SuspendContactRecording and ResumeContactRecording.</p> <p>You
                  can use this API to override the recording behavior configured

                  information about task contacts, see <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/tasks.html">Concepts:
                  Tasks in Amazon Connect</a> in the <i>Amazon Connect
                  Administrator Guide</i>. </p> <p>When using
                  <code>PreviousContactId</code> and
                  <code>RelatedContactId</code> input parameters, note the
                  following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>PreviousContactId</code>
                  </p> <ul> <li> <p>Any updates to user-defined task contact
                  attributes on any contact linked through the same
                  <code>PreviousContactId</code> will affect every contact in
                  the chain.</p> </li> <li> <p>There can be a maximum of 12
                  linked task contacts in a chain. That is, 12 task contacts can
                  be created that share the same
                  <code>PreviousContactId</code>.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>
                  <code>RelatedContactId</code> </p> <ul> <li> <p>Copies contact
                  attributes from the related task contact to the new
                  contact.</p> </li> <li> <p>Any update on attributes in a new
                  task contact does not update attributes on previous
                  contact.</p> </li> <li> <p>There’s no limit on the number of
                  task contacts that can be created that use the same
                  <code>RelatedContactId</code>.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>
                  <p>In addition, when calling StartTaskContact include only one
                  of these parameters: <code>ContactFlowID</code>,
                  <code>QuickConnectID</code>, or <code>TaskTemplateID</code>.
                  Only one parameter is required as long as the task template
                  has a flow configured to run it. If more than one parameter is
                  specified, or only the <code>TaskTemplateID</code> is
                  specified but it does not have a flow configured, the request
                  returns an error because Amazon Connect cannot identify the
                  unique flow to run when the task is created.</p> <p>A
                  <code>ServiceQuotaExceededException</code> occurs when the
                  number of open tasks exceeds the active tasks quota or there
                  are already 12 tasks referencing the same
                  <code>PreviousContactId</code>. For more information about
                  service quotas for task contacts, see <a

                  StopContactRecording is a one-time action. If you use
                  StopContactRecording to stop recording an ongoing call, you
                  can't use StartContactRecording to restart it. For scenarios
                  where the recording has started and you want to suspend it for
                  sensitive information (for example, to collect a credit card
                  number), and then restart it, use SuspendContactRecording and
                  ResumeContactRecording.</p> <p>Only voice recordings are
                  supported at this time.</p>

                  <p>When a contact is being recorded, this API suspends
                  recording whatever is selected in the flow configuration:
                  call, screen, or both. If only call recording or only screen
                  recording is enabled, then it would be suspended. For example,
                  you might suspend the screen recording while collecting
                  sensitive information, such as a credit card number. Then use
                  ResumeContactRecording to restart recording the screen.</p>
                  <p>The period of time that the recording is suspended is
                  filled with silence in the final recording.</p> <p>Voice and
                  screen recordings are supported.</p>

                  <p>This API is in preview release for Amazon Connect and is
                  subject to change.</p> <p>Updates routing priority and age on
                  the contact (<b>QueuePriority</b> and
                  <b>QueueTimeAdjustmentInSeconds</b>). These properties can be
                  used to change a customer's position in the queue. For
                  example, you can move a contact to the back of the queue by
                  setting a lower routing priority relative to other contacts in
                  queue; or you can move a contact to the front of the queue by
                  increasing the routing age which will make the contact look
                  artificially older and therefore higher up in the
                  first-in-first-out routing order. Note that adjusting the
                  routing age of a contact affects only its position in queue,
                  and not its actual queue wait time as reported through
                  metrics. These properties can also be updated by using <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/change-routing-priority.html">the
                  Set routing priority / age flow block</a>.</p>

                  has the ability to invoke <code>UpdateUserIdentityInfo</code>.
                  Someone with that ability can change the login credentials of
                  other users by changing their email address. This poses a
                  security risk to your organization. They can change the email
                  address of a user to the attacker's email address, and then

                  <p>Registers a transit gateway in your global network. Not all

                  Availability</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Transit
                  Gateways for Global Networks User Guide</i>. The transit
                  gateway can be in any of the supported Amazon Web Services
                  Regions, but it must be owned by the same Amazon Web Services
                  account that owns the global network. You cannot register a
                  transit gateway in more than one global network.</p>

                  A dashboard item enables an app to add user-specific
                  information to a user dashboard. Dashboard items are exposed
                  to users as gadgets that users can add to their dashboards.

                  gadgets](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/7AeiLQ).


                  When an app creates a dashboard item it registers a callback
                  to receive the dashboard item ID. The callback fires whenever
                  the item is rendered or, where the item is configurable, the
                  user edits the item. The app then uses this resource to store

                  Evaluates a Jira expression and returns its value.


                  This resource can be used to test Jira expressions that you
                  plan to use elsewhere, or to fetch data in a flexible way.
                  Consult the [Jira expressions
                  documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/)
                  for more details.


                  #### Context variables ####


                  The following context variables are available to Jira
                  expressions evaluated by this resource. Their presence depends
                  on various factors; usually you need to manually request them
                  in the context object sent in the payload, but some of them
                  are added automatically under certain conditions.

                   *  `user` ([User](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user)): The current user. Always available and equal to `null` if the request is anonymous.
                   *  `app` ([App](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#app)): The [Connect app](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/index/#connect-apps) that made the request. Available only for authenticated requests made by Connect Apps (read more here: [Authentication for Connect apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/)).
                   *  `issue` ([Issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): The current issue. Available only when the issue is provided in the request context object.
                   *  `issues` ([List](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#list) of [Issues](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): A collection of issues matching a JQL query. Available only when JQL is provided in the request context object.
                   *  `project` ([Project](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#project)): The current project. Available only when the project is provided in the request context object.
                   *  `sprint` ([Sprint](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#sprint)): The current sprint. Available only when the sprint is provided in the request context object.
                   *  `board` ([Board](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#board)): The current board. Available only when the board is provided in the request context object.
                   *  `serviceDesk` ([ServiceDesk](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#servicedesk)): The current service desk. Available only when the service desk is provided in the request context object.
                   *  `customerRequest` ([CustomerRequest](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#customerrequest)): The current customer request. Available only when the customer request is provided in the request context object.

                  Also, custom context variables can be passed in the request
                  with their types. Those variables can be accessed by key in
                  the Jira expression. These variable types are available for
                  use in a custom context:

                   *  `user`: A [user](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user) specified as an Atlassian account ID.
                   *  `issue`: An [issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue) specified by ID or key. All the fields of the issue object are available in the Jira expression.
                   *  `json`: A JSON object containing custom content.
                   *  `list`: A JSON list of `user`, `issue`, or `json` variable types.

                  This operation can be accessed anonymously.


                  **[Permissions](#permissions) required**: None. However, an
                  expression may return different results for different users
                  depending on their permissions. For example, different users
                  may see different comments on the same issue.  

                  Permission to access Jira Software is required to access Jira
                  Software context variables (`board` and `sprint`) or fields
                  (for example, `issue.sprint`).

                  `issueTypeIds` is empty, the context applies to all issue
                  types.

                   *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueSingleGroupPicker` (type `grouppicker.single`) for single choice group pickers.
                   *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueMultipleGroupPicker` (type `grouppicker.multiple`) for multiple choice group pickers.

                  applies to the project and issue type.


                  If there is no custom field context assigned to the project
                  then, if present, the custom field context that applies to all
                  projects is returned if it also applies to the issue type or
                  all issue types. If a custom field context is not found, the
                  returned custom field context ID is `null`.


                  Duplicate project and issue type mappings cannot be provided
                  in the request.


                  The order of the returned values is the same as provided in
                  the request.

                  would result in it applying to only the listed issue types.


                  If any of the issue types exists in the custom field context,
                  the operation fails and no issue types are added.

                  A custom field context without any projects applies to all
                  projects. Removing all projects from a custom field context
                  would result in it applying to all projects.


                  If any project in the request is not assigned to the context,
                  or the operation would result in two global contexts for the
                  field, the operation fails.

                  Returns a [paginated](#pagination) list of field
                  configurations. The list can be for all field configurations
                  or a subset determined by any combination of these criteria:

                   *  a list of field configuration item IDs.
                   *  whether the field configuration is a default.
                   *  whether the field configuration name or description contains a query string.

                  Only field configurations used in company-managed (classic)
                  projects are returned.

                  This operation can only update field configurations used in

                  The operation can set the renderer for text fields to the
                  default text renderer (`text-renderer`) or wiki style renderer
                  (`wiki-renderer`). However, the renderer cannot be updated for
                  fields using the autocomplete renderer
                  (`autocomplete-renderer`).

                  Only field configuration schemes used in classic projects are
                  returned.

                  subsequently made private that filter is not returned by this

                  known as a global share permission.


                  This operation can be accessed anonymously.


                  **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** None, however, a
                  share permission is only returned for:

                   *  filters owned by the user.
                   *  filters shared with a group that the user is a member of.
                   *  filters shared with a private project that the user has *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for.
                   *  filters shared with a public project.
                   *  filters shared with the public.

                  Returns a list of groups whose names contain a query string. A
                  list of group names can be provided to exclude groups from the
                  results.


                  The primary use case for this resource is to populate a group
                  picker suggestions list. To this end, the returned object
                  includes the `html` field where the matched query term is
                  highlighted in the group name with the HTML strong tag. Also,
                  the groups list is wrapped in a response object that contains
                  a header for use in the picker, specifically *Showing X of Y
                  matching groups*.


                  The list returns with the groups sorted. If no groups match
                  the list criteria, an empty list is returned.


                  This operation can be accessed anonymously.

                  match to an existing group will return an empty list.

                  Returns a list of users and groups matching a string. The
                  string is used:

                   *  for users, to find a case-insensitive match with display name and e-mail address. Note that if a user has hidden their email address in their user profile, partial matches of the email address will not find the user. An exact match is required.
                   *  for groups, to find a case-sensitive match with group name.

                  For example, if the string *tin* is used, records with the
                  display name *Tina*, email address
                  *sarah@tinplatetraining.com*, and the group *accounting* would
                  be returned.


                  Optionally, the search can be refined to:

                   *  the projects and issue types associated with a custom field, such as a user picker. The search can then be further refined to return only users and groups that have permission to view specific:
                      
                       *  projects.
                       *  issue types.
                      
                      If multiple projects or issue types are specified, they must be a subset of those enabled for the custom field or no results are returned. For example, if a field is enabled for projects A, B, and C then the search could be limited to projects B and C. However, if the search is limited to projects B and D, nothing is returned.
                   *  not return Connect app users and groups.
                   *  return groups that have a case-insensitive match with the query.

                  Creates an issue or, where the option to create subtasks is
                  enabled in Jira, a subtask. A transition may be applied, to
                  move the issue or subtask to a workflow step other than the
                  default start step, and issue properties set.


                  The content of the issue or subtask is defined using `update`
                  and `fields`. The fields that can be set in the issue or
                  subtask are determined using the [ Get create issue
                  metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get). These are the
                  same fields that appear on the issue's create screen. Note
                  that the `description`, `environment`, and any `textarea` type
                  custom fields (multi-line text fields) take Atlassian Document
                  Format content. Single line custom fields (`textfield`) accept
                  a string and don't handle Atlassian Document Format content.


                  Creating a subtask differs from creating an issue as follows:

                   *  `issueType` must be set to a subtask issue type (use [ Get create issue metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get) to find subtask issue types).
                   *  `parent` must contain the ID or key of the parent issue.

                  In a next-gen project any issue may be made a child providing
                  that the parent and child are members of the same project.

                  Creates upto **50** issues and, where the option to create
                  subtasks is enabled in Jira, subtasks. Transitions may be
                  applied, to move the issues or subtasks to a workflow step
                  other than the default start step, and issue properties set.


                  The content of each issue or subtask is defined using `update`
                  and `fields`. The fields that can be set in the issue or
                  subtask are determined using the [ Get create issue
                  metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get). These are the
                  same fields that appear on the issues' create screens. Note
                  that the `description`, `environment`, and any `textarea` type
                  custom fields (multi-line text fields) take Atlassian Document
                  Format content. Single line custom fields (`textfield`) accept
                  a string and don't handle Atlassian Document Format content.


                  Creating a subtask differs from creating an issue as follows:

                   *  `issueType` must be set to a subtask issue type (use [ Get create issue metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get) to find subtask issue types).
                   *  `parent` the must contain the ID or key of the parent issue.

                  **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse projects*
                  and *Create issues* [project
                  permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for
                  the project in which each issue or subtask is created.

                  Sets a property value on multiple issues.


                  The value set can be a constant or determined by a [Jira
                  expression](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/).
                  Expressions must be computable with constant complexity when
                  applied to a set of issues. Expressions must also comply with
                  the
                  [restrictions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/#restrictions)
                  that apply to all Jira expressions.


                  The issues to be updated can be specified by a filter.


                  The filter identifies issues eligible for update using these
                  criteria:

                   *  `entityIds` Only issues from this list are eligible.
                   *  `currentValue` Only issues with the property set to this value are eligible.
                   *  `hasProperty`:
                      
                       *  If *true*, only issues with the property are eligible.
                       *  If *false*, only issues without the property are eligible.

                  If more than one criteria is specified, they are joined with
                  the logical *AND*: only issues that satisfy all criteria are
                  eligible.


                  If an invalid combination of criteria is provided, an error is
                  returned. For example, specifying a `currentValue` and
                  `hasProperty` as *false* would not match any issues (because
                  without the property the property cannot have a value).


                  The filter is optional. Without the filter all the issues
                  visible to the user and where the user has the EDIT\_ISSUES
                  permission for the issue are considered eligible.


                  This operation is:

                   *  transactional, either all eligible issues are updated or, when errors occur, none are updated.
                   *  [asynchronous](#async). Follow the `location` link in the response to determine the status of the task and use [Get task](#api-rest-api-3-task-taskId-get) to obtain subsequent updates.

                  Edits an issue. A transition may be applied and issue
                  properties updated as part of the edit.


                  The edits to the issue's fields are defined using `update` and
                  `fields`. The fields that can be edited are determined using [
                  Get edit issue
                  metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueIdOrKey-editmeta-get).


                  The parent field may be set by key or ID. For standard issue
                  types, the parent may be removed by setting
                  `update.parent.set.none` to *true*. Note that the
                  `description`, `environment`, and any `textarea` type custom
                  fields (multi-line text fields) take Atlassian Document Format
                  content. Single line custom fields (`textfield`) accept a
                  string and don't handle Atlassian Document Format content.

                  Tip: Use a client library. Many client libraries have classes
                  for handling multipart POST operations. For example, in Java,
                  the Apache HTTP Components library provides a
                  [MultiPartEntity](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpmime/apidocs/org/apache/http/entity/mime/MultipartEntity.html)
                  class for multipart POST operations.


                  This operation can be accessed anonymously.

            /rest/api/3/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/editmeta:
              get:
                description: >-
                  Returns the edit screen fields for an issue that are visible
                  to and editable by the user. Use the information to populate
                  the requests in [Edit
                  issue](#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueIdOrKey-put).


                  This endpoint will check for these conditions:


                  1.  Field is available on a field screen - through screen,
                  screen scheme, issue type screen scheme, and issue type scheme
                  configuration. `overrideScreenSecurity=true` skips this
                  condition.

                  2.  Field is visible in the [field
                  configuration](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/change-a-field-configuration/).
                  `overrideScreenSecurity=true` skips this condition.

                  3.  Field is shown on the issue: each field has different
                  conditions here. For example: Attachment field only shows if
                  attachments are enabled. Assignee only shows if user has
                  permissions to assign the issue.

                  4.  If a field is custom then it must have valid custom field
                  context, applicable for its project and issue type. All system
                  fields are assumed to have context in all projects and all
                  issue types.

                  5.  Issue has a project, issue type, and status defined.

                  6.  Issue is assigned to a valid workflow, and the current
                  status has assigned a workflow step.
                  `overrideEditableFlag=true` skips this condition.

                  7.  The current workflow step is editable. This is true by
                  default, but [can be disabled by
                  setting](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/use-workflow-properties/)
                  the `jira.issue.editable` property to `false`.
                  `overrideEditableFlag=true` skips this condition.

                  8.  User has [Edit issues
                  permission](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/permissions-for-company-managed-projects/).

                  9.  Workflow permissions allow editing a field. This is true
                  by default but [can be
                  modified](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/use-workflow-properties/)
                  using `jira.permission.*` workflow properties.


                  Fields hidden using [Issue layout settings
                  page](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/configure-field-layout-in-the-issue-view/)
                  remain editable.

                  [global

                  return additional details using:

                   *  `overrideScreenSecurity` When this flag is `true`, then this endpoint skips checking if fields are available through screens, and field configuration (conditions 1. and 2. from the list above).
                   *  `overrideEditableFlag` When this flag is `true`, then this endpoint skips checking if workflow is present and if the current step is editable (conditions 6. and 7. from the list above).

                  This operation can be accessed anonymously.

                  Upon a successful request, the admin who submitted it will

                  and archival-specific fields (`ArchivedBy` and
                  `ArchivedDate`). Custom fields aren't supported.

                  Returns a [paginated](#pagination) list of issue security
                  levels.


                  Only issue security levels in the context of classic projects
                  are returned.


                  Filtering using IDs is inclusive: if you specify both security
                  scheme IDs and level IDs, the result will include both
                  specified issue security levels and all issue security levels
                  from the specified schemes.

                  filter by. Use \{@link
                  IssueSecuritySchemeResource\#searchProjectsUsingSecuritySchemes(String,
                  String, Set, Set)\} to obtain all projects related to scheme.


                  Only issue security schemes in the context of classic projects
                  are returned.

              post:
                description: >-
                  Loads an avatar for the issue type.


                  Specify the avatar's local file location in the body of the
                  request. Also, include the following headers:

                   *  `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` To prevent XSRF protection blocking the request, for more information see [Special Headers](#special-request-headers).
                   *  `Content-Type: image/image type` Valid image types are JPEG, GIF, or PNG.

                  For example:  

                  `curl --request POST \ --user email@example.com:<api_token> \
                  --header 'X-Atlassian-Token: no-check' \ --header
                  'Content-Type: image/< image_type>' \ --data-binary
                  "<@/path/to/file/with/your/avatar>" \ --url
                  'https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issuetype/{issueTypeId}'This`


                  The avatar is cropped to a square. If no crop parameters are
                  specified, the square originates at the top left of the image.
                  The length of the square's sides is set to the smaller of the
                  height or width of the image.


                  The cropped image is then used to create avatars of 16x16,
                  24x24, 32x32, and 48x48 in size.


                  After creating the avatar, use [ Update issue
                  type](#api-rest-api-3-issuetype-id-put) to set it as the issue
                  type's displayed avatar.

                  Assigns an issue type scheme to a project.


                  If any issues in the project are assigned issue types not
                  present in the new scheme, the operation will fail. To
                  complete the assignment those issues must be updated to use
                  issue types in the new scheme.


                  Issue type schemes can only be assigned to classic projects.

                  This operation can filter the custom fields returned by
                  project. Invalid project IDs in `projectIds` are ignored.
                  System fields are always returned.


                  It can also return the collapsed field for custom fields.
                  Collapsed fields enable searches to be performed across all
                  fields with the same name and of the same field type. For
                  example, the collapsed field `Component - Component[Dropdown]`
                  enables dropdown fields `Component - cf[10061]` and `Component
                  - cf[10062]` to be searched simultaneously.

              post:
                description: >-
                  Sanitizes one or more JQL queries by converting readable
                  details into IDs where a user doesn't have permission to view
                  the entity.


                  For example, if the query contains the clause *project =
                  'Secret project'*, and a user does not have browse permission
                  for the project "Secret project", the sanitized query replaces
                  the clause with *project = 12345"* (where 12345 is the ID of
                  the project). If a user has the required permission, the
                  clause is not sanitized. If the account ID is null, sanitizing
                  is performed for an anonymous user.


                  Note that sanitization doesn't make the queries
                  GDPR-compliant, because it doesn't remove user identifiers
                  (username or user key). If you need to make queries
                  GDPR-compliant, use [Convert user identifiers to account IDs
                  in JQL
                  queries](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-jql/#api-rest-api-3-jql-sanitize-post).


                  Before sanitization each JQL query is parsed. The queries are
                  returned in the same order that they were passed.

            /rest/api/3/mypermissions:
              get:
                description: >-
                  Returns a list of permissions indicating which permissions the
                  user has. Details of the user's permissions can be obtained in
                  a global, project, issue or comment context.


                  The user is reported as having a project permission:

                   *  in the global context, if the user has the project permission in any project.
                   *  for a project, where the project permission is determined using issue data, if the user meets the permission's criteria for any issue in the project. Otherwise, if the user has the project permission in the project.
                   *  for an issue, where a project permission is determined using issue data, if the user has the permission in the issue. Otherwise, if the user has the project permission in the project containing the issue.
                   *  for a comment, where the user has both the permission to browse the comment and the project permission for the comment's parent issue. Only the BROWSE\_PROJECTS permission is supported. If a `commentId` is provided whose `permissions` does not equal BROWSE\_PROJECTS, a 400 error will be returned.

                  This means that users may be shown as having an issue
                  permission (such as EDIT\_ISSUES) in the global context or a
                  project context but may not have the permission for any or all
                  issues. For example, if Reporters have the EDIT\_ISSUES
                  permission a user would be shown as having this permission in
                  the global context or the context of a project, because any
                  user can be a reporter. However, if they are not the user who
                  reported the issue queried they would not have EDIT\_ISSUES
                  permission for that issue.


                  Global permissions are unaffected by context.


                  This operation can be accessed anonymously.

                   *  *user.autowatch.disabled* Whether the user automatically watches issues they create or add a comment to. By default, not set: the user takes the instance autowatch setting.

                  Returns the locale for the user.


                  If the user has no language preference set (which is the
                  default setting) or this resource is accessed anonymous, the
                  browser locale detected by Jira is returned. Jira detects the
                  browser locale using the *Accept-Language* header in the
                  request. However, if this doesn't match a locale available
                  Jira, the site default locale is returned.


                  This operation can be accessed anonymously.

                  Returns a [paginated](#pagination) mapping of project that
                  have notification scheme assigned. You can provide either one
                  or multiple notification scheme IDs or project IDs to filter
                  by. If you don't provide any, this will return a list of all
                  mappings. Note that only company-managed (classic) projects
                  are supported. This is because team-managed projects don't
                  have a concept of a default notification scheme. The mappings
                  are ordered by projectId.

                   *  for a list of project permissions and lists of projects and issues, for each project permission a list of the projects and issues a user can access or manipulate.

                  If no account ID is provided, the operation returns details
                  for the logged in user.


                  Note that:

                   *  Invalid project and issue IDs are ignored.
                   *  A maximum of 1000 projects and 1000 issues can be checked.
                   *  Null values in `globalPermissions`, `projectPermissions`, `projectPermissions.projects`, and `projectPermissions.issues` are ignored.
                   *  Empty strings in `projectPermissions.permissions` are ignored.

                  **Deprecation notice:** The required OAuth 2.0 scopes will be
                  updated on June 15, 2024.

                   *  **Classic**: `read:jira-work`
                   *  **Granular**: `read:permission:jira`

                  This operation can be accessed anonymously.


                  **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira*
                  [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg)
                  to check the permissions for other users, otherwise none.
                  However, Connect apps can make a call from the app server to
                  the product to obtain permission details for any user, without
                  admin permission. This Connect app ability doesn't apply to
                  calls made using AP.request() in a browser.

                  ### About permission schemes and grants ###


                  A permission scheme is a collection of permission grants. A
                  permission grant consists of a `holder` and a `permission`.


                  #### Holder object ####


                  The `holder` object contains information about the user or
                  group being granted the permission. For example, the
                  *Administer projects* permission is granted to a group named
                  *Teams in space administrators*. In this case, the type is
                  `"type": "group"`, and the parameter is the group name,
                  `"parameter": "Teams in space administrators"` and the value
                  is group ID, `"value":
                  "ca85fac0-d974-40ca-a615-7af99c48d24f"`.


                  The `holder` object is defined by the following properties:

                   *  `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below).
                   *  `parameter` As a group's name can change, use of `value` is recommended. The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name.
                   *  `value` The value of this property depends on the `type`. If the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group ID. For other `type` it has the same value as `parameter`

                  The following `types` are available. The expected values for
                  `parameter` and `value` are given in parentheses (some types
                  may not have a `parameter` or `value`):

                   *  `anyone` Grant for anonymous users.
                   *  `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name, application name). See [Update product access settings](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3YxjL) for more information.
                   *  `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue.
                   *  `group` Grant for the specified group (`parameter` : group name, `value` : group ID).
                   *  `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (`parameter` : custom field ID, `value` : custom field ID).
                   *  `projectLead` Grant for a project lead.
                   *  `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (`parameter` :project role ID, `value` : project role ID).
                   *  `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue.
                   *  `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24dKLg) for more information.
                   *  `user` Grant for the specified user (`parameter` : user ID - historically this was the userkey but that is deprecated and the account ID should be used, `value` : user ID).
                   *  `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (`parameter` : custom field ID, `value` : custom field ID).

                  #### Built-in permissions ####


                  The [built-in Jira
                  permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) are
                  listed below. Apps can also define custom permissions. See the
                  [project
                  permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/project-permission/)
                  and [global

                  Updates a permission scheme. Below are some important things
                  to note when using this resource:

                   *  If a permissions list is present in the request, then it is set in the permission scheme, overwriting *all existing* grants.
                   *  If you want to update only the name and description, then do not send a permissions list in the request.
                   *  Sending an empty list will remove all permission grants from the permission scheme.

                  If you want to add or delete a permission grant instead of
                  updating the whole list, see [Create permission
                  grant](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-schemeId-permission-post)
                  or [Delete permission scheme
                  entity](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-schemeId-permission-permissionId-delete).


                  See [About permission schemes and
                  grants](../api-group-permission-schemes/#about-permission-schemes-and-grants)
                  for more details.

                  Returns a [paginated](#pagination) list of priorities. The
                  list can contain all priorities or a subset determined by any
                  combination of these criteria:

                   *  a list of priority IDs. Any invalid priority IDs are ignored.
                   *  a list of project IDs. Only priorities that are available in these projects will be returned. Any invalid project IDs are ignored.
                   *  whether the field configuration is a default. This returns priorities from company-managed (classic) projects only, as there is no concept of default priorities in team-managed projects.

                  The project types are available according to the installed
                  Jira features as follows:

                   *  Jira Core, the default, enables `business` projects.
                   *  Jira Service Management enables `service_desk` projects.
                   *  Jira Software enables `software` projects.

                  To determine which features are installed, go to **Jira
                  settings** > **Apps** > **Manage apps** and review the System
                  Apps list. To add Jira Software or Jira Service Management
                  into a JIRA instance, use **Jira settings** > **Apps** >
                  **Finding new apps**. For more information, see [ Managing
                  add-ons](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/S31NLg).

                  You can't delete a project if it's archived. To delete an
                  archived project, restore the project and then delete it. To
                  restore a project, use the Jira UI.

              post:
                description: >-
                  Loads an avatar for a project.


                  Specify the avatar's local file location in the body of the
                  request. Also, include the following headers:

                   *  `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` To prevent XSRF protection blocking the request, for more information see [Special Headers](#special-request-headers).
                   *  `Content-Type: image/image type` Valid image types are JPEG, GIF, or PNG.

                  For example:  

                  `curl --request POST `


                  `--user email@example.com:<api_token> `


                  `--header 'X-Atlassian-Token: no-check' `


                  `--header 'Content-Type: image/< image_type>' `


                  `--data-binary "<@/path/to/file/with/your/avatar>" `


                  `--url
                  'https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/project/{projectIdOrKey}/avatar2'`


                  The avatar is cropped to a square. If no crop parameters are
                  specified, the square originates at the top left of the image.
                  The length of the square's sides is set to the smaller of the
                  height or width of the image.


                  The cropped image is then used to create avatars of 16x16,
                  24x24, 32x32, and 48x48 in size.


                  After creating the avatar use [Set project
                  avatar](#api-rest-api-3-project-projectIdOrKey-avatar-put) to
                  set it as the project's displayed avatar.

                  Returns a [paginated](#pagination) list of all components in a
                  project. See the [Get project
                  components](#api-rest-api-3-project-projectIdOrKey-components-get)
                  resource if you want to get a full list of versions without
                  pagination.


                  If your project uses Compass components, this API will return
                  a list of Compass components that are linked to issues in that
                  project.

                  the project. The list of actors is sorted by display name.


                  To check whether a user belongs to a role based on their group
                  memberships, use [Get user](#api-rest-api-3-user-get) with the
                  `groups` expand parameter selected. Then check whether the
                  user keys and groups match with the actors returned for the
                  project.

                  Get the issue type hierarchy for a next-gen project.


                  The issue type hierarchy for a project consists of:

                   *  *Epic* at level 1 (optional).
                   *  One or more issue types at level 0 such as *Story*, *Task*, or *Bug*. Where the issue type *Epic* is defined, these issue types are used to break down the content of an epic.
                   *  *Subtask* at level -1 (optional). This issue type enables level 0 issue types to be broken down into components. Issues based on a level -1 issue type must have a parent issue.

                  Returns a [paginated](#pagination) list of resolutions. The
                  list can contain all resolutions or a subset determined by any
                  combination of these criteria:

                   *  a list of resolutions IDs.
                   *  whether the field configuration is a default. This returns resolutions from company-managed (classic) projects only, as there is no concept of default resolutions in team-managed projects.

                  Gets a list of all project roles, complete with project role
                  details and default actors.


                  ### About project roles ###


                  [Project
                  roles](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-project-roles/)
                  are a flexible way to to associate users and groups with
                  projects. In Jira Cloud, the list of project roles is shared
                  globally with all projects, but each project can have a
                  different set of actors associated with it (unlike groups,
                  which have the same membership throughout all Jira
                  applications).


                  Project roles are used in [permission
                  schemes](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-get), [email
                  notification schemes](#api-rest-api-3-notificationscheme-get),
                  [issue security
                  levels](#api-rest-api-3-issuesecurityschemes-get), [comment
                  visibility](#api-rest-api-3-comment-list-post), and workflow
                  conditions.


                  #### Members and actors ####


                  In the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is called an
                  *actor*. An *actor* is a group or user associated with a
                  project role.


                  Actors may be set as [default
                  members](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-project-roles/#Specifying-'default-members'-for-a-project-role)
                  of the project role or set at the project level:

                   *  Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects. The default actors can be removed at the project level later if desired.
                   *  Actors: Users and groups that are associated with a project role for a project, which may differ from the default actors. This enables you to assign a user to different roles in different projects.

                  You cannot update both the name and description at the same
                  time using this operation. If you send a request with a name
                  and a description only the name is updated.

                  Changing a project role's default actors does not affect
                  project role members for projects already created.

                  Adds [default actors](#api-rest-api-3-resolution-get) to a
                  role. You may add groups or users, but you cannot add groups
                  and users in the same request.


                  Changing a project role's default actors does not affect
                  project role members for projects already created.

                  Searches for IDs of issues using
                  [JQL](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/egORLQ).


                  Use the [Search](#api-rest-api-3-search-post) endpoint if you
                  need to fetch more than just issue IDs. The Search endpoint
                  returns more information, but may take much longer to respond
                  to requests. This is because it uses a different mechanism for
                  ordering results than this endpoint and doesn't provide the
                  total number of results for your query.

                  Sets the default issue navigator columns.


                  The `columns` parameter accepts a navigable field value and is
                  expressed as HTML form data. To specify multiple columns, pass
                  multiple `columns` parameters. For example, in curl:


                  `curl -X PUT -d columns=summary -d columns=description
                  https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/settings/columns`


                  If no column details are sent, then all default columns are
                  removed.


                  A navigable field is one that can be used as a column on the
                  issue navigator. Find details of navigable issue columns using
                  [Get fields](#api-rest-api-3-field-get).

                  Creates a UI modification. UI modification can only be created
                  by Forge apps.


                  Each app can define up to 3000 UI modifications. Each UI
                  modification can define up to 1000 contexts. The same context
                  can be assigned to maximum 100 UI modifications.


                  **[Permissions](#permissions) required:**

                   *  *None* if the UI modification is created without contexts.
                   *  *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for one or more projects, if the UI modification is created with contexts.

                  Loads a custom avatar for a project or issue type.


                  Specify the avatar's local file location in the body of the
                  request. Also, include the following headers:

                   *  `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` To prevent XSRF protection blocking the request, for more information see [Special Headers](#special-request-headers).
                   *  `Content-Type: image/image type` Valid image types are JPEG, GIF, or PNG.

                  For example:  

                  `curl --request POST `


                  `--user email@example.com:<api_token> `


                  `--header 'X-Atlassian-Token: no-check' `


                  `--header 'Content-Type: image/< image_type>' `


                  `--data-binary "<@/path/to/file/with/your/avatar>" `


                  `--url
                  'https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/universal_avatar/type/{type}/owner/{entityId}'`


                  The avatar is cropped to a square. If no crop parameters are
                  specified, the square originates at the top left of the image.
                  The length of the square's sides is set to the smaller of the
                  height or width of the image.


                  The cropped image is then used to create avatars of 16x16,
                  24x24, 32x32, and 48x48 in size.


                  After creating the avatar use:

                   *  [Update issue type](#api-rest-api-3-issuetype-id-put) to set it as the issue type's displayed avatar.
                   *  [Set project avatar](#api-rest-api-3-project-projectIdOrKey-avatar-put) to set it as the project's displayed avatar.

                  Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the
                  user's preferences. This could mean, for example, that the
                  user's email address is hidden. See the [Profile visibility

                  Returns a list of users who can be assigned issues in one or
                  more projects. The list may be restricted to users whose
                  attributes match a string.


                  This operation takes the users in the range defined by
                  `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and
                  then returns only the users from that range that can be
                  assigned issues in the projects. This means the operation
                  usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To
                  get all the users who can be assigned issues in the projects,
                  use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and
                  filter the records in your code.


                  Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the
                  users' preferences. This could mean, for example, that the
                  user's email address is hidden. See the [Profile visibility
                  overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/)
                  for more details.


                  This operation can be accessed anonymously.

                  Returns a list of users that can be assigned to an issue. Use
                  this operation to find the list of users who can be assigned
                  to:

                   *  a new issue, by providing the `projectKeyOrId`.
                   *  an updated issue, by providing the `issueKey`.
                   *  to an issue during a transition (workflow action), by providing the `issueKey` and the transition id in `actionDescriptorId`. You can obtain the IDs of an issue's valid transitions using the `transitions` option in the `expand` parameter of [ Get issue](#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueIdOrKey-get).

                  In all these cases, you can pass an account ID to determine if
                  a user can be assigned to an issue. The user is returned in
                  the response if they can be assigned to the issue or issue
                  transition.


                  This operation takes the users in the range defined by
                  `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and
                  then returns only the users from that range that can be
                  assigned the issue. This means the operation usually returns
                  fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the
                  users who can be assigned the issue, use [Get all
                  users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the
                  records in your code.

            /rest/api/3/user/permission/search:
              get:
                description: >-
                  Returns a list of users who fulfill these criteria:

                   *  their user attributes match a search string.
                   *  they have a set of permissions for a project or issue.

                  If no search string is provided, a list of all users with the
                  permissions is returned.


                  This operation takes the users in the range defined by
                  `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and
                  then returns only the users from that range that match the
                  search string and have permission for the project or issue.
                  This means the operation usually returns fewer users than
                  specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who match the
                  search string and have permission for the project or issue,
                  use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and
                  filter the records in your code.


                  Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the
                  users' preferences. This could mean, for example, that the
                  user's email address is hidden. See the [Profile visibility
                  overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/)
                  for more details.


                  This operation can be accessed anonymously.


                  **[Permissions](#permissions) required:**

                   *  *Administer Jira* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg), to get users for any project.
                   *  *Administer Projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for a project, to get users for that project.

              get:
                description: >-
                  Returns a list of users whose attributes match the query term.
                  The returned object includes the `html` field where the
                  matched query term is highlighted with the HTML strong tag. A
                  list of account IDs can be provided to exclude users from the
                  results.


                  This operation takes the users in the range defined by
                  `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only
                  the users from that range that match the query term. This
                  means the operation usually returns fewer users than specified
                  in `maxResults`. To get all the users who match the query
                  term, use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get)
                  and filter the records in your code.


                  Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the
                  users' preferences. This could mean, for example, that the
                  user's email address is hidden. See the [Profile visibility
                  overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/)
                  for more details.


                  This operation can be accessed anonymously.

                  Returns a list of active users that match the search string
                  and property.


                  This operation first applies a filter to match the search
                  string and property, and then takes the filtered users in the
                  range defined by `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the
                  thousandth user. To get all the users who match the search
                  string and property, use [Get all
                  users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the
                  records in your code.


                  This operation can be accessed anonymously.


                  Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the
                  users' preferences. This could mean, for example, that the
                  user's email address is hidden. See the [Profile visibility
                  overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/)
                  for more details.

            /rest/api/3/user/search/query:
              get:
                description: >-
                  Finds users with a structured query and returns a
                  [paginated](#pagination) list of user details.


                  This operation takes the users in the range defined by
                  `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and
                  then returns only the users from that range that match the
                  structured query. This means the operation usually returns
                  fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the
                  users who match the structured query, use [Get all
                  users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the
                  records in your code.


                  **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and
                  groups* [global
                  permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).


                  The query statements are:

                   *  `is assignee of PROJ` Returns the users that are assignees of at least one issue in project *PROJ*.
                   *  `is assignee of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that are assignees on the issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
                   *  `is reporter of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that are reporters on the issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
                   *  `is watcher of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that are watchers on the issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
                   *  `is voter of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that are voters on the issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
                   *  `is commenter of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that have posted a comment on the issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
                   *  `is transitioner of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that have performed a transition on issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
                   *  `[propertyKey].entity.property.path is "property value"` Returns users with the entity property value.

                  The list of issues can be extended as needed, as in *(PROJ-1,
                  PROJ-2, ... PROJ-n)*. Statements can be combined using the
                  `AND` and `OR` operators to form more complex queries. For
                  example:


                  `is assignee of PROJ AND [propertyKey].entity.property.path is
                  "property value"`

            /rest/api/3/user/viewissue/search:
              get:
                description: >-
                  Returns a list of users who fulfill these criteria:

                   *  their user attributes match a search string.
                   *  they have permission to browse issues.

                  Use this resource to find users who can browse:

                   *  an issue, by providing the `issueKey`.
                   *  any issue in a project, by providing the `projectKey`.

                  This operation takes the users in the range defined by
                  `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and
                  then returns only the users from that range that match the
                  search string and have permission to browse issues. This means
                  the operation usually returns fewer users than specified in
                  `maxResults`. To get all the users who match the search string
                  and have permission to browse issues, use [Get all
                  users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the
                  records in your code.


                  Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the
                  users' preferences. This could mean, for example, that the
                  user's email address is hidden. See the [Profile visibility
                  overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/)
                  for more details.


                  This operation can be accessed anonymously.


                  **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and
                  groups* [global
                  permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).
                  Anonymous calls and calls by users without the required
                  permission return empty search results.

                  Merges two project versions. The merge is completed by
                  deleting the version specified in `id` and replacing any
                  occurrences of its ID in `fixVersion` with the version ID
                  specified in `moveIssuesTo`.

                  version](#api-rest-api-3-version-id-removeAndSwap-post)
                  instead. This resource supports swapping version values in
                  `fixVersion`, `affectedVersion`, and custom fields.

                  Alternative versions can be provided to update issues that use
                  the deleted version in `fixVersion`, `affectedVersion`, or any
                  version picker custom fields. If alternatives are not
                  provided, occurrences of `fixVersion`, `affectedVersion`, and
                  any version picker custom field, that contain the deleted
                  version, are cleared. Any replacement version must be in the
                  same project as the version being deleted and cannot be the
                  version being deleted.

                  only if there is a match between the app owner and the user
                  who registered a dynamic webhook.

                  Returns webhooks that have recently failed to be delivered to
                  the requesting app after the maximum number of retries.


                  After 72 hours the failure may no longer be returned by this
                  operation.


                  The oldest failure is returned first.


                  This method uses a cursor-based pagination. To request the
                  next page use the failure time of the last webhook on the list
                  as the `failedAfter` value or use the URL provided in `next`.

                  Creates a workflow. You can define transition rules using the
                  shapes detailed in the following sections. If no transitional
                  rules are specified the default system transition rules are
                  used. Note: This only applies to company-managed scoped
                  workflows. Use [bulk create
                  workflows](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-workflows/#api-rest-api-3-workflows-create-post)
                  to create both team and company-managed scoped workflows.


                  #### Conditions ####


                  Conditions enable workflow rules that govern whether a
                  transition can execute.


                  ##### Always false condition #####


                  A condition that always fails.

                      {
                         "type": "AlwaysFalseCondition"
                       }

                  ##### Block transition until approval #####


                  A condition that blocks issue transition if there is a pending
                  approval.

                      {
                         "type": "BlockInProgressApprovalCondition"
                       }

                  ##### Compare number custom field condition #####


                  A condition that allows transition if a comparison between a
                  number custom field and a value is true.

                      {
                         "type": "CompareNumberCFCondition",
                         "configuration": {
                           "comparator": "=",
                           "fieldId": "customfield_10029",
                           "fieldValue": 2
                         }
                       }

                   *  `comparator` One of the supported comparator: `=`, `>`, and `<`.
                   *  `fieldId` The custom numeric field ID. Allowed field types:
                      
                       *  `com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.customfieldtypes:float`
                       *  `com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:jsw-story-points`
                   *  `fieldValue` The value for comparison.

                  ##### Hide from user condition #####


                  A condition that hides a transition from users. The transition
                  can only be triggered from a workflow function or REST API
                  operation.

                      {
                         "type": "RemoteOnlyCondition"
                       }

                  ##### Only assignee condition #####


                  A condition that allows only the assignee to execute a
                  transition.

                      {
                         "type": "AllowOnlyAssignee"
                       }

                  ##### Only Bamboo notifications workflow condition
                  (deprecated) #####


                  A condition that makes the transition available only to Bamboo
                  build notifications.

                      {
                         "type": "OnlyBambooNotificationsCondition"
                       }

                  ##### Only reporter condition #####


                  A condition that allows only the reporter to execute a
                  transition.

                      {
                         "type": "AllowOnlyReporter"
                       }

                  ##### Permission condition #####


                  A condition that allows only users with a permission to
                  execute a transition.

                      {
                         "type": "PermissionCondition",
                         "configuration": {
                             "permissionKey": "BROWSE_PROJECTS"
                         }
                       }

                   *  `permissionKey` The permission required to perform the transition. Allowed values: [built-in](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-permission-schemes/#built-in-permissions) or app defined permissions.

                  ##### Previous status condition #####


                  A condition that allows a transition based on whether an issue
                  has or has not transitioned through a status.

                      {
                         "type": "PreviousStatusCondition",
                         "configuration": {
                           "ignoreLoopTransitions": true,
                           "includeCurrentStatus": true,
                           "mostRecentStatusOnly": true,
                           "reverseCondition": true,
                           "previousStatus": {
                             "id": "5"
                           }
                         }
                       }

                  By default this condition allows the transition if the status,
                  as defined by its ID in the `previousStatus` object, matches
                  any previous issue status, unless:

                   *  `ignoreLoopTransitions` is `true`, then loop transitions (from and to the same status) are ignored.
                   *  `includeCurrentStatus` is `true`, then the current issue status is also checked.
                   *  `mostRecentStatusOnly` is `true`, then only the issue's preceding status (the one immediately before the current status) is checked.
                   *  `reverseCondition` is `true`, then the status must not be present.

                  ##### Separation of duties condition #####


                  A condition that prevents a user to perform the transition, if
                  the user has already performed a transition on the issue.

                      {
                         "type": "SeparationOfDutiesCondition",
                         "configuration": {
                           "fromStatus": {
                             "id": "5"
                           },
                           "toStatus": {
                             "id": "6"
                           }
                         }
                       }

                   *  `fromStatus` OPTIONAL. An object containing the ID of the source status of the transition that is blocked. If omitted any transition to `toStatus` is blocked.
                   *  `toStatus` An object containing the ID of the target status of the transition that is blocked.

                  ##### Subtask blocking condition #####


                  A condition that blocks transition on a parent issue if any of
                  its subtasks are in any of one or more statuses.

                      {
                         "type": "SubTaskBlockingCondition",
                         "configuration": {
                           "statuses": [
                             {
                               "id": "1"
                             },
                             {
                               "id": "3"

                       }

                   *  `statuses` A list of objects containing status IDs.

                  ##### User is in any group condition #####


                  A condition that allows users belonging to any group from a
                  list of groups to execute a transition.

                      {
                         "type": "UserInAnyGroupCondition",

                         }
                       }

                   *  `fieldId` The ID of a field used in the comparison.
                   *  `fieldValue` The expected value of the field.
                   *  `comparisonType` The type of the comparison. Allowed values: `STRING`, `NUMBER`, `DATE`, `DATE_WITHOUT_TIME`, or `OPTIONID`.
                   *  `comparator` One of the supported comparator: `>`, `>=`, `=`, `<=`, `<`, `!=`.

                  **Notes:**

                   *  If you choose the comparison type `STRING`, only `=` and `!=` are valid options.
                   *  You may leave `fieldValue` empty when comparison type is `!=` to indicate that a value is required in the field.
                   *  For date fields without time format values as `yyyy-MM-dd`, and for those with time as `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`. For example, for July 16 2021 use `2021-07-16`, for 8:05 AM use `2021-07-16 08:05`, and for 4 PM: `2021-07-16 16:00`.

                  Returns a [paginated](#pagination) list of workflows with
                  transition rules. The workflows can be filtered to return only
                  those containing workflow transition rules:

                   *  of one or more transition rule types, such as [workflow post functions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/workflow-post-function/).
                   *  matching one or more transition rule keys.

                  Only workflows containing transition rules created by the
                  calling
                  [Connect](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/index/#connect-apps)
                  or
                  [Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/index/#forge-apps)
                  app are returned.


                  Due to server-side optimizations, workflows with an empty list
                  of rules may be returned; these workflows can be ignored.

                  Updates configuration of workflow transition rules. The
                  following rule types are supported:

                   *  [post functions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/workflow-post-function/)
                   *  [conditions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/workflow-condition/)
                   *  [validators](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/workflow-validator/)

                  Only rules created by the calling
                  [Connect](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/index/#connect-apps)
                  or
                  [Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/index/#forge-apps)
                  app can be updated.


                  To assist with app migration, this operation can be used to:

                   *  Disable a rule.
                   *  Add a `tag`. Use this to filter rules in the [Get workflow transition rule configurations](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-workflow-transition-rules/#api-rest-api-3-workflow-rule-config-get).

                  Rules are enabled if the `disabled` parameter is not provided.


                  **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Only
                  [Connect](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/index/#connect-apps)

                  Updates a workflow transition by changing the property value.
                  Trying to update a property that does not exist results in a
                  new property being added to the transition. Transition
                  properties are used to change the behavior of a transition.
                  For more information, see [Transition
                  properties](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/zIhKLg#Advancedworkflowconfiguration-transitionproperties)

                  Get the list of workflow capabilities for a specific workflow
                  using either the workflow ID, or the project and issue type ID
                  pair. The response includes the scope of the workflow, defined
                  as global/project-based, and a list of project types that the
                  workflow is scoped to. It also includes all rules organised
                  into their broad categories (conditions, validators, actions,
                  triggers, screens) as well as the source location
                  (Atlassian-provided, Connect, Forge).


                  **[Permissions](#permissions) required:**

                   *  *Administer Jira* project permission to access all, including global-scoped, workflows
                   *  *Administer projects* project permissions to access project-scoped workflows

                  The current list of Atlassian-provided rules:


                  #### Validators ####


                  A validator rule that checks if a user has the required
                  permissions to execute the transition in the workflow.


                  ##### Permission validator #####


                  A validator rule that checks if a user has the required
                  permissions to execute the transition in the workflow.

                      {
                         "ruleKey": "system:check-permission-validator",
                         "parameters": {
                           "permissionKey": "ADMINISTER_PROJECTS"
                         }
                       }

                  Parameters:

                   *  `permissionKey` The permission required to perform the transition. Allowed values: [built-in Jira permissions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-permission-schemes/#built-in-permissions).

                  ##### Parent or child blocking validator #####


                  A validator to block the child issue\\u2019s transition
                  depending on the parent issue\\u2019s status.

                      {
                         "ruleKey" : "system:parent-or-child-blocking-validator"
                         "parameters" : {
                           "blocker" : "PARENT"
                           "statusIds" : "1,2,3"
                         }
                       }

                  Parameters:

                   *  `blocker` currently only supports `PARENT`.
                   *  `statusIds` a comma-separated list of status IDs.

                  ##### Previous status validator #####


                  A validator that checks if an issue has transitioned through
                  specified previous status(es) before allowing the current
                  transition to occur.

                      {
                         "ruleKey": "system:previous-status-validator",
                         "parameters": {
                           "previousStatusIds": "10014",
                           "mostRecentStatusOnly": "true"
                         }
                       }

                  Parameters:

                   *  `previousStatusIds` a comma-separated list of status IDs, currently only support one ID.
                   *  `mostRecentStatusOnly` when `true` only considers the most recent status for the condition evaluation. Allowed values: `true`, `false`.

                  ##### Validate a field value #####


                  A validation that ensures a specific field's value meets the
                  defined criteria before allowing an issue to transition in the
                  workflow.


                  Depending on the rule type, the result will vary:


                  ###### Field required ######

                  Parameters:

                   *  `fieldsRequired` the ID of the field that is required. For a custom field, it would look like `customfield_123`.
                   *  `ignoreContext` controls the impact of context settings on field validation. When set to `true`, the validator doesn't check a required field if its context isn't configured for the current issue. When set to `false`, the validator requires a field even if its context is invalid. Allowed values: `true`, `false`.
                   *  `errorMessage` is the error message to display if the user does not provide a value during the transition. A default error message will be shown if you don't provide one (Optional).

                       }

                  #### Conditions ####


                  Conditions enable workflow rules that govern whether a
                  transition can execute.


                  ##### Check field value #####


                  A condition rule evaluates as true if a specific field's value
                  meets the defined criteria. This rule ensures that an issue
                  can only transition to the next step in the workflow if the
                  field's value matches the desired condition.

                      {
                         "ruleKey": "system:check-field-value",
                         "parameters": {
                           "fieldId": "description",
                           "fieldValue": "[\"Done\"]",
                           "comparator": "=",
                           "comparisonType": "STRING"
                         }
                       }

                  Parameters:

                   *  `fieldId` The ID of the field to check the value of. For non-system fields, it will look like `customfield_123`. Note: `fieldId` is used interchangeably with the idea of `fieldKey` here, they refer to the same field.
                   *  `fieldValue` the list of values to check against the field\\u2019s value.
                   *  `comparator` The comparison logic. Allowed values: `>`, `>=`, `=`, `<=`, `<`, `!=`.
                   *  `comparisonType` The type of data being compared. Allowed values: `STRING`, `NUMBER`, `DATE`, `DATE_WITHOUT_TIME`, `OPTIONID`.

                  ##### Restrict issue transition #####


                  This rule ensures that issue transitions are restricted based
                  on user accounts, roles, group memberships, and permissions,
                  maintaining control over who can transition an issue. This
                  condition evaluates as `true` if any of the following criteria
                  is met.

                      {
                         "ruleKey": "system:restrict-issue-transition",

                           "denyUserCustomFields": "customfield_10107"
                         }
                       }

                  Parameters:

                   *  `accountIds` a comma-separated list of the user account IDs. It also allows generic values like: `allow-assignee`, `allow-reporter`, and `accountIds` Note: This is only supported in team-managed projects
                   *  `roleIds` a comma-separated list of role IDs.
                   *  `groupIds` a comma-separated list of group IDs.

                   *  `groupCustomFields` a comma-separated list of group custom field IDs.
                   *  `allowUserCustomFields` a comma-separated list of user custom field IDs to allow for issue transition.
                   *  `denyUserCustomFields` a comma-separated list of user custom field IDs to deny for issue transition.

                  This rule is composed by aggregating the following legacy
                  rules:

                   *  AllowOnlyAssignee
                   *  AllowOnlyReporter
                   *  InAnyProjectRoleCondition

                   *  InGroupCFCondition
                   *  UserIsInCustomFieldCondition

                  ##### Previous status condition #####


                  A condition that evaluates based on an issue's previous
                  status(es) and specific criteria.

                      {
                         "ruleKey" : "system:previous-status-condition"
                         "parameters" : {

                  ##### Remind people to update fields #####


                  A screen rule that prompts users to update a specific field
                  when they interact with an issue screen during a transition.
                  This rule is useful for ensuring that users provide or modify
                  necessary information before moving an issue to the next step
                  in the workflow.

                      {
                         "ruleKey": "system:remind-people-to-update-fields",
                         "params": {
                           "remindingFieldIds": "assignee,customfield_10025",
                           "remindingMessage": "The message",
                           "remindingAlwaysAsk": "true"
                         }
                       }

                  Parameters:

                   *  `remindingFieldIds` a comma-separated list of field IDs. Note: `fieldId` is used interchangeably with the idea of `fieldKey` here, they refer to the same field.
                   *  `remindingMessage` the message to display when prompting the users to update the fields.
                   *  `remindingAlwaysAsk` always remind to update fields. Allowed values: `true`, `false`.

                  Returns a list of the workflow schemes associated with a list
                  of projects. Each returned workflow scheme includes a list of
                  the requested projects associated with it. Any team-managed or
                  non-existent projects in the request are ignored and no errors
                  are returned.


                  If the project is associated with the `Default Workflow
                  Scheme` no ID is returned. This is because the way the
                  `Default Workflow Scheme` is stored means it has no ID.

                  Updates company-managed and team-managed project workflow
                  schemes. This API doesn't have a concept of draft, so any
                  changes made to a workflow scheme are immediately available.
                  When changing the available statuses for issue types, an
                  [asynchronous task](#async) migrates the issues as defined in
                  the provided mappings.

                  the name, default workflow, issue type to project mappings,
                  and more. If the workflow scheme is active (that is, being
                  used by at least one project), then a draft workflow scheme is
                  created or updated instead, provided that
                  `updateDraftIfNeeded` is set to `true`.

                  Resets the default workflow for a workflow scheme. That is,
                  the default workflow is set to Jira's system workflow (the
                  *jira* workflow).


                  Note that active workflow schemes cannot be edited. If the
                  workflow scheme is active, set `updateDraftIfNeeded` to `true`
                  and a draft workflow scheme is created or updated with the
                  default workflow reset. The draft workflow scheme can be
                  published in Jira.

                  Sets the default workflow for a workflow scheme.


                  Note that active workflow schemes cannot be edited. If the
                  workflow scheme is active, set `updateDraftIfNeeded` to `true`
                  in the request object and a draft workflow scheme is created
                  or updated with the new default workflow. The draft workflow
                  scheme can be published in Jira.

                  Returns the draft workflow scheme for an active workflow
                  scheme. Draft workflow schemes allow changes to be made to the
                  active workflow schemes: When an active workflow scheme is
                  updated, a draft copy is created. The draft is modified, then
                  the changes in the draft are copied back to the active
                  workflow scheme. See [Configuring workflow
                  schemes](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/tohKLg) for more
                  information.  

                  Note that:

                   *  Only active workflow schemes can have draft workflow schemes.
                   *  An active workflow scheme can only have one draft workflow scheme.

                  Updates a draft workflow scheme. If a draft workflow scheme
                  does not exist for the active workflow scheme, then a draft is
                  created. Note that an active workflow scheme can only have one
                  draft workflow scheme.

                  Publishes a draft workflow scheme.


                  Where the draft workflow includes new workflow statuses for an
                  issue type, mappings are provided to update issues with the
                  original workflow status to the new workflow status.


                  This operation is [asynchronous](#async). Follow the
                  `location` link in the response to determine the status of the
                  task and use [Get task](#api-rest-api-3-task-taskId-get) to
                  obtain updates.

                  workflow scheme.


                  Note that active workflow schemes cannot be edited. If the
                  workflow scheme is active, set `updateDraftIfNeeded` to `true`
                  and a draft workflow scheme is created or updated with the
                  issue type-workflow mapping deleted. The draft workflow scheme
                  can be published in Jira.

                  Note that active workflow schemes cannot be edited. If the
                  workflow scheme is active, set `updateDraftIfNeeded` to `true`
                  in the request body and a draft workflow scheme is created or
                  updated with the new issue type-workflow mapping. The draft
                  workflow scheme can be published in Jira.

                  Deletes the workflow-issue type mapping for a workflow in a
                  workflow scheme.


                  Note that active workflow schemes cannot be edited. If the
                  workflow scheme is active, set `updateDraftIfNeeded` to `true`
                  and a draft workflow scheme is created or updated with the
                  workflow-issue type mapping deleted. The draft workflow scheme
                  can be published in Jira.

                  Sets the issue types for a workflow in a workflow scheme. The
                  workflow can also be set as the default workflow for the
                  workflow scheme. Unmapped issues types are mapped to the
                  default workflow.


                  Note that active workflow schemes cannot be edited. If the
                  workflow scheme is active, set `updateDraftIfNeeded` to `true`
                  in the request body and a draft workflow scheme is created or
                  updated with the new workflow-issue types mappings. The draft
                  workflow scheme can be published in Jira.

                  Returns a list of IDs and delete timestamps for worklogs
                  deleted after a date and time.


                  This resource is paginated, with a limit of 1000 worklogs per
                  page. Each page lists worklogs from oldest to youngest. If the
                  number of items in the date range exceeds 1000, `until`
                  indicates the timestamp of the youngest item on the page.
                  Also, `nextPage` provides the URL for the next page of
                  worklogs. The `lastPage` parameter is set to true on the last
                  page of worklogs.


                  This resource does not return worklogs deleted during the
                  minute preceding the request.

                  Returns a list of IDs and update timestamps for worklogs
                  updated after a date and time.


                  This resource is paginated, with a limit of 1000 worklogs per
                  page. Each page lists worklogs from oldest to youngest. If the
                  number of items in the date range exceeds 1000, `until`
                  indicates the timestamp of the youngest item on the page.
                  Also, `nextPage` provides the URL for the next page of
                  worklogs. The `lastPage` parameter is set to true on the last
                  page of worklogs.


                  This resource does not return worklogs updated during the
                  minute preceding the request.


                  **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access
                  Jira, however, worklogs are only returned where either of the
                  following is true:

                   *  the worklog is set as *Viewable by All Users*.
                   *  the user is a member of a project role or group with permission to view the worklog.

                  **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Only a Connect app
                  whose key matches `addonKey` can make this request.

                  Additionally, Forge apps can access Connect app properties
                  (stored against the same `app.connect.key`).

                ### About notification schemes ###


                A notification scheme is a list of events and recipients who
                will receive notifications for those events. The list is
                contained within the `notificationSchemeEvents` object and
                contains pairs of `events` and `notifications`:

                 *  `event` Identifies the type of event. The events can be [Jira system events](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/configure-notification-schemes/) (see the *Events* section) or [custom events](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/add-a-custom-event/).
                 *  `notifications` Identifies the [recipients](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-recipientsRecipients) of notifications for each event. Recipients can be any of the following types:
                    
                     *  `CurrentAssignee`
                     *  `Reporter`
                     *  `CurrentUser`
                     *  `ProjectLead`
                     *  `ComponentLead`
                     *  `User` (the `parameter` is the user key)
                     *  `Group` (the `parameter` is the group name)
                     *  `ProjectRole` (the `parameter` is the project role ID)
                     *  `EmailAddress` *(deprecated)*
                     *  `AllWatchers`
                     *  `UserCustomField` (the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)
                     *  `GroupCustomField`(the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)

                Issue security schemes control which users or groups of users
                can view an issue. When an issue security scheme is associated
                with a project, its security levels can be applied to issues in
                that project. Sub-tasks also inherit the security level of their
                parent issue.

                ### About issue security schemes ###


                Issue security schemes control which users or groups of users
                can view an issue. An issue security scheme is made up of
                multiple security levels. Each level can have users or groups of
                users assigned to it. The following are valid security level
                members:

                 *  Individual users
                 *  Groups of users
                 *  Project roles
                 *  Issue roles
                 *  "Anyone", for example to allow anonymous access
                 *  A (multi-)user or (multi-)group picker custom field

                  The Jira REST API enables you to interact with Jira

              - anchor: version
                body: >
                  This documentation is for **version 3** of the Jira Cloud
                  platform REST API, which is the latest version

                  but is in **beta**. [Version
                  2](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/)
                  and 

                  version 3 of the API offer the same collection of operations.
                  However, version 3 provides support for 

                  the [Atlassian Document
                  Format](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/apis/document/structure/) 

                  (ADF) in: 

                  - `body` in comments, including where comments are used in
                  issue, issue link, and transition resources.

                  - `comment` in worklogs.

                  - `description` and `environment` fields in issues.

                  - `textarea` type custom fields (multi-line text fields) in
                  issues. Single line custom fields 
                    (`textfield`) accept a string and don't handle Atlassian Document Format content.

                  However, these new features are under development and may

                  ### Forge apps


                  For Forge apps, [REST API
                  scopes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/scopes-for-oauth-2-3LO-and-forge-apps/) 

                  are used when authenticating with Jira Cloud platform. See
                  [Add scopes to call an Atlassian REST
                  API](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/add-scopes-to-call-an-atlassian-rest-api/)
                  for more details.


                  The URIs for Forge app REST API calls have this structure:


                  `/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


                  For example, `/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`


                  ### Connect apps


                  For Connect apps, authentication (JWT-based) is built into the
                  Connect libraries. Authorization is implemented using either 

                  scopes (shown as _App scope required_ for operations on this
                  page) or user impersonation. See 

                  [Security for Connect
                  apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/) 

                  for details.


                  The URIs for Connect app REST API calls have this structure:


                  `https://<site-url>/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


                  For example,
                  `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`


                  ### Other integrations


                  For integrations that are not Forge or Connect apps, use OAuth
                  2.0 authorization code grants (3LO) for security 

                  (3LO scopes are shown as for operations _OAuth scopes
                  required_). See 

                  [OAuth 2.0 (3LO)
                  apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/) 

                  for details.


                  The URIs for OAuth 2.0 (3LO) app REST API calls have this
                  structure:


                  `https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/<cloudId>/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


                  For example,
                  `https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/35273b54-3f06-40d2-880f-dd28cf8daafa/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`


                  ### Ad-hoc API calls


                  For personal scripts, bots, and ad-hoc execution of the REST
                  APIs use basic authentication. See [Basic auth for REST
                  APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/)
                  for details. 


                  The URIs for basic authentication REST API calls have this
                  structure:


                  `https://<site-url>/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


                  For example,
                  `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`

                  ### Operation permissions


                  Most operations in this API require permissions. The calling
                  user must have the required permissions for an operation to 

                  use it. Note that for Connect apps, the app user must have the
                  required permissions for the operation and the app must 

                  have scopes that permit the operation.


                  A permission can be granted to a group, project role, or issue
                  role that the user is a member of, or granted directly to a
                  user. 

                  See [Permissions
                  overview](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ) for
                  details. The most common permissions are:


                  - **Administer the Cloud site**: Users in the _site-admins_
                  group have this 

                  permission. See [Manage
                  groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) for details.

                  - **Administer Jira**: Granted by the _Jira Administrators_
                  global permission. There is a default group for this
                  permission. 

                  See [Manage groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL)
                  and [Managing global
                  permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) for
                  details.

                  - **Administer a project in Jira**: Granted by the _Administer
                  projects_ project permission for a project. This can be 

                  granted to a user, a group, a project role, and more. 

                  See [Managing project
                  permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for
                  details.

                  - **Access a project in Jira**: Granted by the _Browse
                  projects_ project permission for a project. This can be 

                  granted to a user, a group, a project role, and more. 

                  See [Managing project
                  permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for
                  details.

                  - **Access Jira**: Granted by the _Jira Users_ global
                  permission. Users in the default product access group (for
                  example, 

                  _jira-software-users-acmesite_) have this permission. 

                  See [Manage groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL)
                  and

                  permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) for
                  details.


                  ### Anonymous access


                  Some operations provide support for anonymous access. However,
                  anonymous access is only available if 

                  the Jira permission needed to access the object or records
                  returned by the operation is granted to 

                  the _Public_ group. See [Allowing anonymous access to your
                  project](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/GDxxLg) 

                  for details.


                  If an operation is called anonymously and anonymous access is
                  not available, the operation will return 

                  an error. Note that not all operations that correspond to
                  objects that can be given public access 

                  provide for anonymous access.

                  ### Expansion


                  The Jira REST API uses resource expansion, which means that
                  some parts of a resource are not returned unless specified 

                  in the request. This simplifies responses and minimizes
                  network traffic.


                  To expand part of a resource in a request, use the expand
                  query parameter and specify the object(s) to be expanded. 

                  If you need to expand nested objects, use the `.` dot
                  notation. If you need to expand multiple objects, use a 

                  comma-separated list. 


                  For example, the following request expands the `names` and
                  `renderedFields` properties for the _JRACLOUD-34423_ issue:


                  `GET issue/JRACLOUD-34423?expand=names,renderedFields`


                  To discover which object can be expanded, refer to the
                  `expand` property in the object. 

                  In the JSON example below, the resource declares `widgets` as
                  expandable.


                  ```json

                  {
                    "expand": "widgets", 
                    "self": "https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/resource/KEY-1", 
                    "widgets": {
                      "widgets": [],
                      "size": 5
                     }
                  }

                  ```


                  ### Pagination


                  The Jira REST API uses pagination to improve performance.
                  Pagination is enforced for operations that could return a
                  large 

                  collection of items. When you make a request to a paginated
                  resource, the response wraps the returned array of values in 

                  a JSON object with paging metadata. For example:


                  ```json

                  {
                      "startAt" : 0,
                      "maxResults" : 10,
                      "total": 200,
                      "isLast": false,
                      "values": [
                          { /* result 0 */ },
                          { /* result 1 */ },
                          { /* result 2 */ }
                      ]
                  }

                  ```


                  *   `startAt` is the index of the first item returned in the
                  page.

                  *   `maxResults` is the maximum number of items that a page
                  can return. Each operation can have a different limit for
                      the number of items returned, and these limits may change without notice. To find the maximum number of items 
                      that an operation could return, set `maxResults` to a large number—for example, over 1000—and if the returned value of `maxResults` is less than the requested value, the returned value is the maximum.
                  *    `total` is the total number of items contained in all
                  pages. This number **_may change_** as the client 

                  requests the subsequent pages, therefore the client should
                  always assume that the requested page can be empty. Note 

                  that this property is not returned for all operations.

                  *   `isLast` indicates whether the page returned is the last
                  one. Note that this property is not returned for all
                  operations.


                  ### Ordering


                  Some operations support ordering the elements of a response by
                  a field. Check the documentation for the operation to 

                  confirm whether ordering of a response is supported and which
                  fields can be used. Responses are listed in ascending order 

                  by default. You can change the order using the `orderby` query
                  parameter with a `-` or `+` symbol. For example:


                  *   `?orderBy=name` to order by `name` field ascending.

                  *   `?orderBy=+name` to order by `name` field ascending.

                  *   `?orderBy=-name` to order by `name` field descending.

                  system default user time zone.


                  To return date time data in the logged in user's timezone,

                  The following request and response headers define important
                  metadata for the Jira Cloud REST API resources.


                  -   `X-Atlassian-Token` (request): Operations that accept
                  multipart/form-data must include the `X-Atlassian-Token:
                  no-check`

                  header in requests. Otherwise the request is blocked by
                  cross-site request forgery (CSRF/XSRF) protection.

                  -   `X-Force-Accept-Language` (request): controls how the
                  standard HTTP `Accept-Language` header is processed.

                  By default `Accept-Language` is ignored and the response is in
                  the language configured in the user's profile or,

                  when no language is configured for the user, the default Jira
                  instance language. For the response to recognize

                  `Accept-Language` send `X-Force-Accept-Language = true` as
                  well. If `Accept-Language` requests a language that Jira

                  can return the response is in that language, otherwise Jira
                  returns the response in the default language. If

                  `Accept-Language` is not specified the response is in the
                  default language.

                  -   `X-AAccountId` (response): This response header contains
                  the Atlassian account ID of the authenticated user.

                   Jira provides for all permissions, except the [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) Administer Jira, to be assigned to *Anyone*. Once a permission is assigned to *Anyone*, anyone knowing a project's URL is able to use the features in Jira enabled by the permission. However, the Jira REST API does not enable anonymous access for operations by default. This means that an anonymous user who may be able to perform an action through Jira, may not be able to perform the same action where it's enabled by the REST API. 

                   The operations that provide anonymous access are annotated "This operation can be accessed anonymously."
                title: Anonymous operations
              - anchor: async-operations
                body: >-
                  Some Jira REST API operations may trigger long-running or
                  computationally expensive tasks. In these cases, the
                  operation 

                  will schedule an asynchronous task and return a `303 (See
                  Other)` response, indicating the location of the queued task 

                  in the `Location` header. You can query this task to get
                  progress updates.


                  When the task finishes, the response object will contain the
                  `result` field. The content of the field is specific to the 

                  operation that created the task. Refer to the operation’s
                  documentation for more information.


                  Note that asynchronous tasks are not guaranteed to be run in
                  order. In other words, if you need your tasks to execute 

                  in a certain order, you should start a task only after the
                  prerequisite task(s) have finished.

                  {

                      ...
                      { ... }
                    ],
                    "limit": 25,
                    "size": 25,
                    ...
                    "_links": {
                      "base": "<url>",

                    }
                  }

                  ```


                  When additional results are available, returns `next` and
                  `prev` URLs to retrieve them in subsequent calls. The URLs
                  each contain a cursor that points to the appropriate set of
                  results. Use `limit` to specify the number of results returned
                  in each call.

                  Example subsequent call (taken from example response):

                  ```

                  /wiki/rest/api/content/search?cql=type=page&limit=25&cursor=raNDoMsTRiNg

                  ```

                  The response to this will have a `prev` URL similar to the
                  `next` in the example response.

                  Moves a pagetree rooted at a page to the space's trash:


                  - If the content's type is `page` and its status is `current`,
                  it will be trashed including

                  all its descendants.

                  - For every other combination of content type and status, this
                  API is not supported.


                  This API accepts the pageTree delete request and returns a
                  task ID.

                  The delete process happens asynchronously.

                   Response example:
                   <pre><code>
                   {
                        "id" : "1180606",

                  API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/v2/intro/).


                  Returns a map of the direct children of a piece of content. A
                  piece of content

                  has different types of child content, depending on its type.
                  These are

                  the default parent-child content type relationships:


                  - `page`: child content is `page`, `comment`, `attachment`

                  - `blogpost`: child content is `comment`, `attachment`

                  - `attachment`: child content is `comment`

                  - `comment`: child content is `attachment`


                  Apps can override these default relationships. Apps can also
                  introduce

                  new content types that create new parent-child content
                  relationships.


                  Note, the map will always include all child content types that
                  are valid

                  for the content. However, if the content has no instances of a
                  child content

                  type, the map will contain an empty array for that child
                  content type.

                  attachment is created).


                  Note, you must set a `X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck` header on
                  the request

                  for this method, otherwise it will be blocked. This protects

                  attacks, which is necessary as this method accepts
                  multipart/form-data.


                  The media type 'multipart/form-data' is defined in [RFC
                  7578](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7578.txt).

                  Most client libraries have classes that make it easier to
                  implement

                  multipart posts, like the
                  [MultipartEntityBuilder](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.1.x/current/httpclient5/apidocs/)

                  Java class provided by Apache HTTP Components.


                  Note, according to [RFC
                  7578](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7578#section-4.5),

                  in the case where the form data is text,

                  the charset parameter for the "text/plain" Content-Type may be
                  used to

                  indicate the character encoding used in that part. In the case
                  of this

                  API endpoint, the `comment` body parameter should be sent with
                  `type=text/plain`

                  and `charset=utf-8` values. This will force the charset to be
                  UTF-8.


                  Example: This curl command attaches a file ('example.txt') to
                  a piece of

                  content (id='123') with a comment and `minorEdits`=true. If
                  the 'example.txt'

                  file already exists, it will update it with a new version of
                  the attachment.


                  ``` bash

                  curl -D- \
                    -u admin:admin \

                    -H 'X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck' \
                    -F 'file=@"example.txt"' \
                    -F 'minorEdit="true"' \
                    -F 'comment="Example attachment comment"; type=text/plain; charset=utf-8' \

                  7578](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7578#section-4.5),

                  in the case where the form data is text,

                  the charset parameter for the "text/plain" Content-Type may be
                  used to

                  indicate the character encoding used in that part. In the case
                  of this

                  API endpoint, the `comment` body parameter should be sent with
                  `type=text/plain`

                  and `charset=utf-8` values. This will force the charset to be
                  UTF-8.


                  Example: This curl command attaches a file ('example.txt') to
                  a container

                  (id='123') with a comment and `minorEdits`=true.

                  ID, and

                  optionally the comment and the minor edit field.


                  This method is essentially the same as [Create or update
                  attachments](#api-content-id-child-attachment-put),

                  except that it matches the attachment ID rather than the name.


                  Note, you must set a `X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck` header on
                  the request

                  for this method, otherwise it will be blocked. This protects
                  against XSRF

                  attacks, which is necessary as this method accepts
                  multipart/form-data.


                  The media type 'multipart/form-data' is defined in [RFC
                  7578](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7578.txt).

                  Most client libraries have classes that make it easier to
                  implement

                  multipart posts, like the
                  [MultipartEntityBuilder](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.1.x/current/httpclient5/apidocs/)

                  is similar

                  that this

                  direct

                  child pages.


                  A piece of content has different types of descendants,

                  - `page`: descendant is `page`, `comment`, `attachment`

                  - `blogpost`: descendant is `comment`, `attachment`

                  - `attachment`: descendant is `comment`

                  - `comment`: descendant is `attachment`


                  The map will always include all descendant types that are
                  valid for the content.

                  However, if the content has no instances of a descendant type,
                  the map will

                  contain an empty array for that descendant type.

                  except that this method returns child pages at all levels,
                  rather than just

                  the direct child pages.


                  A piece of content has different types of descendants,
                  depending on its type:


                  - `page`: descendant is `page`, `comment`, `attachment`

                  - `blogpost`: descendant is `comment`, `attachment`

                  - `attachment`: descendant is `comment`

                  - `comment`: descendant is `attachment`


                  Custom content types that are provided by apps can also be
                  returned.

                  Returns the body of a macro in storage format, for the given
                  macro ID.

                  This includes information like the name of the macro, the body
                  of the macro,

                  and any macro parameters. This method is mainly used by Cloud
                  apps.


                  About the macro ID: When a macro is created in a new version
                  of content,

                  Confluence will generate a random ID for it, unless an ID is
                  specified

                  (by an app). The macro ID will look similar to this:
                  '50884bd9-0cb8-41d5-98be-f80943c14f96'.

                  The ID is then persisted as new versions of content are
                  created, and is

                  only modified by Confluence if there are conflicting IDs.


                  Note, to preserve backwards compatibility this resource will
                  also match on

                  the hash of the macro body, even if a macro ID is found. This
                  check will

                  eventually become redundant, as macro IDs are generated for
                  pages and

                  transparently propagate out to all instances.

                description: >-
                  Copy page hierarchy allows the copying of an entire hierarchy
                  of pages and their associated properties, permissions and
                  attachments.
                   The id path parameter refers to the content id of the page to copy, and the new parent of this copied page is defined using the destinationPageId in the request body.
                   The titleOptions object defines the rules of renaming page titles during the copy;
                   for example, search and replace can be used in conjunction to rewrite the copied page titles.

                   Response example:
                   <pre><code>
                   {
                        "id" : "1180606",
                        "links" : {
                             "status" : "/rest/api/longtask/1180606"
                        }
                   }
                   </code></pre>
                   Use the /longtask/<taskId> REST API to get the copy task status.

                  Returns whether the specified content restriction applies to a
                  group.

                  For example, if a page with `id=123` has a `read` restriction
                  for the `admins` group,

                  the following request will return `true`:


                  `/wiki/rest/api/content/123/restriction/byOperation/read/group/admins`


                  Note that a response of `true` does not guarantee that the
                  group can view the page, as it does not account for

                  account-inherited restrictions, space permissions, or even
                  product access. For more

                  has an 'ignore' relationship with:

                  `GET

                  Note, 'ignore' is an example custom relationship type.

                description: >-
                  Creates a relationship between two entities (user, space,
                  content). The

                  'favourite' relationship is supported by default, but you can
                  use this method

                  to create any type of relationship between two entities.


                  For example, the following method creates a 'sibling'
                  relationship between

                  two pieces of content:

                  For example, the following method finds all users that have a
                  'collaborator'

                  relationship to a piece of content with an ID of '1234':

                  Note, 'collaborator' is an example custom relationship type.

                  `user.accountid`, and `user.userkey`.** 

                  See this [deprecation
                  notice](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/deprecation-notice-search-api/)
                  for more details.


                  Example initial call:

                  ```

                  /wiki/rest/api/search?cql=type=page&limit=25

                  ```


                  Example response:

                  ```

                  {
                    "results": [
                      { ... },
                      { ... },
                      ...
                      { ... }
                    ],
                    "limit": 25,
                    "size": 25,
                    ...
                    "_links": {
                      "base": "<url>",
                      "context": "<url>",
                      "next": "/rest/api/search?cql=type=page&limit=25&cursor=raNDoMsTRiNg",
                      "self": "<url>"
                    }
                  }

                  ```


                  When additional results are available, returns `next` and
                  `prev` URLs to retrieve them in subsequent calls. The URLs
                  each contain a cursor that points to the appropriate set of
                  results. Use `limit` to specify the number of results returned
                  in each call.


                  Example subsequent call (taken from example response):

                  ```

                  /wiki/rest/api/search?cql=type=page&limit=25&cursor=raNDoMsTRiNg

                  ```

                  The response to this will have a `prev` URL similar to the
                  `next` in the example response.

                  Note that CQL input queries submitted through the
                  `/wiki/rest/api/search/user` endpoint only support
                  user-specific fields like `user`, `user.fullname`,
                  `user.accountid`, and `user.userkey`.


                  Note that some user fields may be set to null depending on the
                  user's privacy settings.

                  These are: email, profilePicture, displayName, and timeZone.

                  -   For security reasons, permissions cannot be updated via
                  the API and

                  must be changed via the user interface instead.

                  -   Currently you cannot set space labels when updating a
                  space.

                  Therefore, the space may not be deleted yet when this method
                  has

                  returned. Clients should poll the status link that is returned
                  in the

                  response until the task completes.

                  - If the template is a content template, it is deleted.

                  - If the template is a modified space-level blueprint
                  template, it reverts

                  to the template inherited from the global-level blueprint
                  template.

                  - If the template is a modified global-level blueprint
                  template, it reverts

                  to the default global-level blueprint template.

                   Note, unmodified blueprint templates cannot be deleted.

                  This is the reference for the Confluence Cloud REST API. This
                  API is the primary way to get and

                  modify data in Confluence Cloud, whether you are developing an
                  app or any other integration.

                  Use it to interact with Confluence entities, like pages and
                  blog posts, spaces, users, groups,

                  and more.

                anchor: auth
                body: >-
                  **Authentication:** If you are building a Cloud app,
                  authentication is implemented via JWT or OAuth 2.0, depending
                  on what you are building (see [Security
                  overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/security-overview/)).
                  Otherwise, if you are authenticating directly against the REST
                  API, the REST API supports basic auth (see [Basic auth for
                  REST
                  APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/)).


                  **Authorization:** If you are building a Cloud app,
                  authorization can be implemented by
                  [scopes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/scopes/)
                  or by [OAuth 2.0 user
                  impersonation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/oauth-2-jwt-bearer-tokens-for-apps).
                  Otherwise, if you are making calls directly against the REST
                  API, authorization is based on the user used in the
                  authentication process.


                  See [Security
                  overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/security-overview/)

                body: >-
                  The Confluence REST API uses the [standard HTTP status
                  codes](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).


                  Responses that return an error status code will also return a
                  response body, similar to the following:

                  ```json

                  {
                    "statusCode": 404,
                    "data": {
                      "authorized": false,
                      "valid": false,
                      "errors": [
                        {
                          "message": {
                            "translation": "This is an example error message.",
                            "args": []
                          }
                        }
                      ],
                      "successful": false
                    },
                    "message": "This is an example error message."
                  }

                  ```
              - title: Using the REST API
                anchor: using
                body: >-
                  **Expansion:** The Confluence REST API uses resource
                  expansion: some parts of a resource are not returned unless
                  explicitly specified. This simplifies responses and minimizes
                  network traffic.


                  To expand part of a resource in a request, use the `expand`
                  query parameter and specify the entities to be expanded. If
                  you need to expand nested entities, use the `.` dot notation.
                  For example, the following request will expand information
                  about the requested content's space and labels:

                  ```

                  GET /wiki/rest/api/content/{id}?expand=space,metadata.labels

                  ```

                  **Pagination:** The Confluence REST API uses pagination: a
                  method that returns a response with multiple objects can only
                  return a limited number at one time. This limits the size of
                  responses and conserves server resources.


                  Use the 'limit' and 'start' query parameters to specify
                  pagination:


                  - `limit` is the number of objects to return per page. This
                  may be restricted by system limits.

                  - `start` is the index of the first item returned in the page
                  of results. The base index is 0.


                  For example, the following request will return ten content
                  objects, starting from the fifth object.

                  ```

                  GET /wiki/rest/api/content?start=4&limit=10

                  ```

                  **Special headers:**


                  - `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` request header must be
                  specified for methods

                  that are protected from Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF/CSRF)
                  attacks. This is

                  stated in the method description, if required. For more
                  information, see this

                  **Webhooks:** A webhook is a user-defined callback over HTTP.
                  You can use Confluence webhooks to notify your app or web
                  application when certain events occur in Confluence. For
                  example, when a page is created or updated. To learn more, see
                  [Webhooks](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/modules/webhook/).


                  **Content properties:** Content properties are a key-value
                  storage associated with a piece of Confluence content. If you
                  are building an app, this is one form of persistence that you
                  can use. You can use the Confluence REST API to get, update,
                  and delete content properties. To learn more, see [Content
                  properties in the REST
                  API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/content-properties/).


                  **CQL:** The Confluence Query Language (CQL) allows you to
                  perform complex searches for content using an SQL-like syntax
                  in the `search` resource. To learn more, see [Advanced

                description: >
                  The returned data is taken from the in-memory cache for
                  performance

                  reasons which means inactive users may be omitted from the
                  response.


                  All non-inactive users WILL be returned and some inactive
                  users MAY

                  be included. Any omitted user IS inactive.


                  Returned records are sorted by user ID, ascending.


                  This method is expensive. It pulls ALL records from the cache,
                  sorts them and then only uses a subset.

                  For large numbers of users, this can be very inefficient both
                  due to sorting

                  and due to the cache being distributed across many nodes.


                  Addiionally, there is the potential to miss users if they
                  become active

                  after the page in which their user ID falls has already been
                  read by the client.

                  To avoid this situation, a presence feed should be created
                  (and optionally read from)

                  first to capture presence changes of users who get reactivated
                  during a paged call to this endpoint.

                  The caller is not included in the members of the

                  created chat.


                  Duplicate users will be included in the membership of the chat
                  but

                  the duplication will be silently ignored.


                  If there is an existing IM conversation with the same set of
                  participants then

                  the id of that existing stream will be returned.

                summary: Allows iteration of all file extensions supported for upload
                description: >
                  Provides a RESTful API to iterate all file extensions
                  configured by the tenant admin

                  that are allowed for the upload.  Pagination of this list is
                  managed through a

                  combination of the optional request parameters and
                  service-side managed maximums.


                  Pagination of the results is provided through the before or
                  after input paramters

                  and presented through the opaque cursor values provided as
                  output from a previous

                  response.  Only one of before or after or neither may be
                  provided.


                  DO NOT store cursors. Cursors can quickly become invalid if
                  items are added or deleted.

                  Use them only during a short-period of time that you are
                  traversing the list.
