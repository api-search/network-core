                  phone number service level quota, you will be blocked from
                  claiming any more numbers until 30 days past the oldest number
                  released has expired. </p> <p>For example, if you already have
                  99 claimed numbers and a service level quota of 99 phone
                  numbers, and in any 30 day period you release 99, claim 99,
                  and then release 99, you will have exceeded the 200% limit. At
                  that point you are blocked from claiming any more numbers
                  until you open an Amazon Web Services support ticket.</p>

                  API. It provides more flexibility, features, and the ability
                  to query longer time ranges than <code>GetMetricData</code>.
                  Use it to retrieve historical agent and contact metrics for
                  the last 3 months, at varying intervals. You can also use it
                  to build custom dashboards to measure historical queue and
                  agent performance. For example, you can track the number of
                  incoming contacts for the last 7 days, with data split by day,
                  to see how contact volume changed per day of the week.</p>

                  <p>StartContactRecording is a one-time action. For example, if

                  call, you can't use StartContactRecording to restart it. For
                  scenarios where the recording has started and you want to
                  suspend and resume it, such as when collecting sensitive
                  information (for example, a credit card number), use
                  SuspendContactRecording and ResumeContactRecording.</p> <p>You

                  <p>Places an outbound call to a contact, and then initiates
                  the flow. It performs the actions in the flow that's specified
                  (in <code>ContactFlowId</code>).</p> <p>Agents do not initiate
                  the outbound API, which means that they do not dial the
                  contact. If the flow places an outbound call to a contact, and
                  then puts the contact in queue, the call is then routed to the
                  agent, like any other inbound case.</p> <p>There is a
                  60-second dialing timeout for this operation. If the call is
                  not connected after 60 seconds, it fails.</p> <note> <p>UK

                  you can dial these UK mobile numbers, you must submit a
                  service quota increase request. For more information, see <a

                  linked task contacts in a chain. That is, 12 task contacts can
                  be created that share the same
                  <code>PreviousContactId</code>.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>
                  <code>RelatedContactId</code> </p> <ul> <li> <p>Copies contact
                  attributes from the related task contact to the new

                  Only one parameter is required as long as the task template
                  has a flow configured to run it. If more than one parameter is

                  specified but it does not have a flow configured, the request

                  <code>ServiceQuotaExceededException</code> occurs when the

                  StopContactRecording is a one-time action. If you use
                  StopContactRecording to stop recording an ongoing call, you
                  can't use StartContactRecording to restart it. For scenarios
                  where the recording has started and you want to suspend it for
                  sensitive information (for example, to collect a credit card
                  number), and then restart it, use SuspendContactRecording and
                  ResumeContactRecording.</p> <p>Only voice recordings are
                  supported at this time.</p>

                  <p>When a contact is being recorded, this API suspends
                  recording whatever is selected in the flow configuration:
                  call, screen, or both. If only call recording or only screen
                  recording is enabled, then it would be suspended. For example,
                  you might suspend the screen recording while collecting
                  sensitive information, such as a credit card number. Then use
                  ResumeContactRecording to restart recording the screen.</p>

                  filled with silence in the final recording.</p> <p>Voice and

                  <p>This API is in preview release for Amazon Connect and is
                  subject to change.</p> <p>Updates routing priority and age on
                  the contact (<b>QueuePriority</b> and
                  <b>QueueTimeAdjustmentInSeconds</b>). These properties can be
                  used to change a customer's position in the queue. For
                  example, you can move a contact to the back of the queue by
                  setting a lower routing priority relative to other contacts in
                  queue; or you can move a contact to the front of the queue by
                  increasing the routing age which will make the contact look
                  artificially older and therefore higher up in the
                  first-in-first-out routing order. Note that adjusting the
                  routing age of a contact affects only its position in queue,
                  and not its actual queue wait time as reported through
                  metrics. These properties can also be updated by using <a
                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/change-routing-priority.html">the
                  Set routing priority / age flow block</a>.</p>

                  <p>Updates the identity information for the specified
                  user.</p> <important> <p>We strongly recommend limiting who
                  has the ability to invoke <code>UpdateUserIdentityInfo</code>.
                  Someone with that ability can change the login credentials of
                  other users by changing their email address. This poses a
                  security risk to your organization. They can change the email
                  address of a user to the attacker's email address, and then
                  reset the password through email. For more information, see <a

      <p> <b>Introduction</b> </p> <p>The Amazon IVS Chat control-plane API
      enables you to create and manage Amazon IVS Chat resources. You also need
      to integrate with the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/chatmsgapireference/chat-messaging-api.html">
      Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API</a>, to enable users to interact with chat
      rooms in real time.</p> <p>The API is an AWS regional service. For a list
      of supported regions and Amazon IVS Chat HTTPS service endpoints, see the
      Amazon IVS Chat information on the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ivs.html">Amazon IVS
      page</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>. </p> <p> <b>Notes on
      terminology:</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p>You create service applications using
      the Amazon IVS Chat API. We refer to these as <i>applications</i>.</p>
      </li> <li> <p>You create front-end client applications (browser and
      Android/iOS apps) using the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API. We refer to
      these as <i>clients</i>. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Resources</b> </p> <p>The
      following resources are part of Amazon IVS Chat:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <b>LoggingConfiguration</b> — A configuration that allows customers to
      store and record sent messages in a chat room. See the Logging
      Configuration endpoints for more information.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Room</b> — The central Amazon IVS Chat resource through which clients
      connect to and exchange chat messages. See the Room endpoints for more
      information.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Tagging</b> </p> <p>A <i>tag</i> is a
      metadata label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag comprises a
      <i>key</i> and a <i>value</i>, both set by you. For example, you might set
      a tag as <code>topic:nature</code> to label a particular video category.
      See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html">Tagging
      AWS Resources</a> for more information, including restrictions that apply
      to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS Chat has no
      service-specific constraints beyond what is documented there.</p> <p>Tags
      can help you identify and organize your AWS resources. For example, you
      can use the same tag for different resources to indicate that they are
      related. You can also use tags to manage access (see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html">Access
      Tags</a>).</p> <p>The Amazon IVS Chat API has these tag-related endpoints:
      <a>TagResource</a>, <a>UntagResource</a>, and <a>ListTagsForResource</a>.
      The following resource supports tagging: Room.</p> <p>At most 50 tags can
      be applied to a resource.</p> <p> <b>API Access Security</b> </p> <p>Your
      Amazon IVS Chat applications (service applications and clients) must be
      authenticated and authorized to access Amazon IVS Chat resources. Note the
      differences between these concepts:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <i>Authentication</i> is about verifying identity. Requests to the Amazon
      IVS Chat API must be signed to verify your identity.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <i>Authorization</i> is about granting permissions. Your IAM roles need to
      have permissions for Amazon IVS Chat API requests.</p> </li> </ul>
      <p>Users (viewers) connect to a room using secure access tokens that you
      create using the <a>CreateChatToken</a> endpoint through the AWS SDK. You
      call CreateChatToken for every user’s chat session, passing identity and
      authorization information about the user.</p> <p> <b>Signing API
      Requests</b> </p> <p>HTTP API requests must be signed with an AWS SigV4
      signature using your AWS security credentials. The AWS Command Line
      Interface (CLI) and the AWS SDKs take care of signing the underlying API
      calls for you. However, if your application calls the Amazon IVS Chat HTTP
      API directly, it’s your responsibility to sign the requests.</p> <p>You
      generate a signature using valid AWS credentials for an IAM role that has
      permission to perform the requested action. For example, DeleteMessage
      requests must be made using an IAM role that has the
      <code>ivschat:DeleteMessage</code> permission.</p> <p>For more
      information:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Authentication and generating signatures —
      See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating
      Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)</a> in the <i>Amazon
      Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Managing Amazon IVS
      permissions — See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/security-iam.html">Identity
      and Access Management</a> on the Security page of the <i>Amazon IVS User
      Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)</b> </p>
      <p>ARNs uniquely identify AWS resources. An ARN is required when you need
      to specify a resource unambiguously across all of AWS, such as in IAM
      policies and API calls. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Amazon
      Resource Names</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>.</p> <p>
      <b>Messaging Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DeleteMessage</a> — Sends
      an event to a specific room which directs clients to delete a specific
      message; that is, unrender it from view and delete it from the client’s
      chat history. This event’s <code>EventName</code> is
      <code>aws:DELETE_MESSAGE</code>. This replicates the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/chatmsgapireference/actions-deletemessage-publish.html">
      DeleteMessage</a> WebSocket operation in the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging
      API.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DisconnectUser</a> — Disconnects all
      connections using a specified user ID from a room. This replicates the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/chatmsgapireference/actions-disconnectuser-publish.html">
      DisconnectUser</a> WebSocket operation in the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging
      API.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>SendEvent</a> — Sends an event to a room. Use
      this within your application’s business logic to send events to clients of

      <note> <p>Amazon Q is in preview release and is subject to change.</p>
      </note> <p>This is the <i>Amazon Q (for business use)</i> API Reference.
      Amazon Q is a fully managed, generative-AI powered enterprise chat
      assistant that you can deploy within your organization. Amazon Q enhances
      employee productivity by supporting key tasks such as question-answering,
      knowledge discovery, writing email messages, summarizing text, drafting
      document outlines, and brainstorming ideas. Users ask questions of Amazon
      Q and get answers that are presented in a conversational manner. For an
      introduction to the service, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/business-use-dg/what-is.html">
      <i>Amazon Q (for business use) Developer Guide</i> </a>.</p> <p>For an

                   You provide the server with the public part of the key pair that you are going to use to create the value of the signature header for all future API calls. The server creates an installation for you. Store the Installation Token and ServerPublicKey from the response. This token is used in the "X-Bunq-Client-Authentication" header for the creation of a DeviceServer and SessionServer.

                    This endpoint is an interface for initializing a request for an answer from FactSet Mercury, our large language model for surfacing FactSet datasets through conversational natural language queries. Use the `/create` endpoint to start generating responses for one-off questions. Responses contain a chat ID and status for the chat process.

      Chat models take a list of messages as input and return a model-generated
      message as output. Although the chat format is designed to make multi-turn
      conversations easy, it’s just as useful for single-turn tasks without any
      conversation.
